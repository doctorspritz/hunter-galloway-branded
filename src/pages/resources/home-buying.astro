  {
    question: "How do I know if I'm ready to buy a home?",

    <ul>
      <li>Stable employment (ideally 6+ months in your current job)</li>
      <li>A deposit saved (minimum 5%, ideally 10-20%)</li>
      <li>Good credit history with no major defaults</li>
      <li>Clear understanding of your budget and ongoing costs</li>

    <p>Use our <a href="/resources/blog/first-home-buyers/readiness-guide/">First Home Buyer Readiness Guide</a> for a complete assessment.</p>`
  },
  {
    question: "What's the home buying process timeline?",
    answer: `<p>The typical home buying timeline is 3-6 months:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Pre-approval:</strong> 1-2 weeks</li>
      <li><strong>House hunting:</strong> 4-12 weeks</li>
      <li><strong>Making an offer:</strong> 1-7 days</li>
      <li><strong>Loan approval:</strong> 2-3 weeks</li>
      <li><strong>Settlement:</strong> 30-90 days</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This can vary based on market conditions and your preparedness.</p>`
  },

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Minimum:</strong> 5% with Lenders Mortgage Insurance (LMI)</li>
      <li><strong>Ideal:</strong> 20% to avoid LMI costs</li>

  },
  {
    question: "Should I get pre-approval before looking at homes?",
    answer: `<p>Yes, absolutely! Pre-approval is essential because:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You'll know your exact budget before falling in love with a property</li>
      <li>Sellers and agents take you more seriously</li>
      <li>You can move quickly when you find the right property</li>
      <li>It identifies any issues early that could delay your purchase</li>
