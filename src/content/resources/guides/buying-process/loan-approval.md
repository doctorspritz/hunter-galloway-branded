A lender would fix a date to transfer the property in your name, which usually takes a period of 30 days. However, the number of days varies from one case to another and it can also be negotiated by the new and current owner. After all the formalities are completed and the property is transferred to your name, you become the new owner.</span></p> <p></p> <div class="hub_pr_n_arrows"><i class="fa fa-angle-left" aria-hidden="true"></i></div> <div class="hub_previous">Previous</div> <div class="hub_previous_link"><a href="https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/hub/finalise-settlement/pay-your-house-deposit/">Pay your house deposit</a></div> <p></p> <div class="hub_pr_n_arrows"><i class="fa fa-angle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i></div> <div class="hub_next">Next</div> <div class="hub_next_link"><a href="https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/hub/finalise-settlement/get-insurance-right-away/">Get insurance right away</a></div> <p><link rel='stylesheet' href='https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/OwlCarousel2/2.1.3/assets/owl.carousel.min.css'><script src='https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/OwlCarousel2/2.1.3/owl.carousel.min.js'></script><script src='https://use.fontawesome.com/826a7e3dce.js'></script></p> <style>.carousel-wrap { margin: 90px auto; padding: 0 5%; width: 80%; position: relative;}/* fix blank or flashing items on carousel */.owl-carousel .item { position: relative; z-index: 100; -webkit-backface-visibility: hidden; }/* end fix */.owl-nav > div { margin-top: -26px; position: absolute; top: 50%; color: #cdcbcd;}.owl-nav i { font-size: 52px;}.owl-nav .owl-prev { left: -30px;}.owl-nav .owl-next { right: -30px;}</style> <p><script>jQuery('.owl-carousel').owlCarousel({ loop: true, margin: 10, nav: true, navText: --> "<i class='fa fa-caret-left'></i>", "<i class='fa fa-caret-right'></i>" ], autoplay: false, autoplayHoverPause: false, responsive: { 0: { items: 1 }, 600: { items: 3 }, 1000: { items: 3 } }})</script></p>
