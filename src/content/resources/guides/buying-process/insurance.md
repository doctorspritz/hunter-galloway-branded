Not having home insurance is very risky, as it covers you for any loss or damage to the building.</p> <p class="p3"><span class="s1">Your bank or lender will want proof the property has insurance on it, so it’s best to get it right away because you are going to need it eventually. </span><span class="s2">Sometimes lenders want their borrowers to get building insurance before proceeding with the settlement. In fact, they want it to be included in the policy.</span></p> <div id="attachment_8082" style="width: 687px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8082" class="size-full wp-image-8082" src="https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/home-insurance-quote.png" alt="home-insurance-quote" width="677" height="793" /><p id="caption-attachment-8082" class="wp-caption-text">Getting a home insurance quote is as easy as going online.</p></div> <p> </p> <p class="p6"><span class="s2"><b>Why Do You Need Building Insurance?</b></span></p> <p class="p1">There is often confusion about who is responsible for the property insurance for the period from signing the contract until settlement.</p> <p class="p1">According to FindLaw:</p> <p class="p6"><span class="s2">In Queensland, contrary to the practice adopted in some other states and sometimes assumed by parties to the property transaction, the standard terms of contract usually provide for the risk in a property to pass from the seller to the buyer, not from the settlement date, but from 5 p.m. on the first business day after the date that the seller signs the contract.</span></p> <p class="p6"><span class="s2">So you need to make sure you have insurance from 5 p.m. on the first business day after the date of signing the contract of sale; it’s incredibly important.</span></p> <p class="p6"><span class="s2">When you plan to buy a house, it is important to protect your property against any possible risks. Building insurance usually gives you coverage against any damage that may occur due to rainwater, fire and most natural disasters. It covers items such as air conditioners, switches, cables, pipes, light fittings, hot water system and more. In many cases, gates and fences are also covered in the insurance contract. It also provides coverage of valuable items like washing machines, furniture and computers.</span></p> <p class="p6"><span class="s2">Many insurance companies design discounted bundles that allow you to get coverage for the building and the belongings too.</span></p> <p class="p6"><span class="s2"><b>How Much Should You Insure for?</b></span></p> <p class="p6"><span class="s2">This is a critical answer that has to be decided when it comes to organising building insurance. Building insurance will cover the labour and raw material cost that is required to rebuild the house if it gets destroyed by any natural disaster or other reasons.</span></p> <p class="p6"><span class="s2">Normally, an insurance company estimates the insurance amount in two ways:</span></p> <ul class="ul1"> <li class="li6"><span class="s2">It evaluates the condition of different building elements to compute the rebuilding cost. This gives the insurer an idea about how much the cost (labour and raw material) of what they need to reconstruct the building will be.</span></li> <li class="li6"><span class="s2">The company uses a cost per square metre method, which gives a rough estimate of the material used and the size of the building.</span></li> </ul> <p class="p6"><span class="s2">Underinsuring is a very common problem in Australia. If you are buying a house in a high-risk area where floods or forest fires are common, it is better to get a correct estimate of how much you should get to receive complete coverage in case of a disaster.</span></p> <p><div id="attachment_8092" style="width: 950px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8092" class="size-full wp-image-8092" src="https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fhog-fire.jpg" alt="fhog-fire" width="940" height="627" /><p id="caption-attachment-8092" class="wp-caption-text">Home &amp; Contents insure protects you from Fire &amp; Theft.</p></div><br /> </p> <div class="hub_pr_n_arrows"><i class="fa fa-angle-left" aria-hidden="true"></i></div> <div class="hub_previous">Previous</div> <div class="hub_previous_link"><a href="https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/hub/finalise-settlement/get-formal-approval/">Get formal approval</a></div> <p></p> <div class="hub_pr_n_arrows"><i class="fa fa-angle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i></div> <div class="hub_next">Next</div> <div class="hub_next_link"><a href="https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/hub/finalise-settlement/arrange-building-pest-inspection/">Arrange building & pest inspection</a></div> <p><link rel='stylesheet' href='https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/OwlCarousel2/2.1.3/assets/owl.carousel.min.css'><script src='https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/OwlCarousel2/2.1.3/owl.carousel.min.js'></script><script src='https://use.fontawesome.com/826a7e3dce.js'></script></p> <style>.carousel-wrap { margin: 90px auto; padding: 0 5%; width: 80%; position: relative;}/* fix blank or flashing items on carousel */.owl-carousel .item { position: relative; z-index: 100; -webkit-backface-visibility: hidden; }/* end fix */.owl-nav > div { margin-top: -26px; position: absolute; top: 50%; color: #cdcbcd;}.owl-nav i { font-size: 52px;}.owl-nav .owl-prev { left: -30px;}.owl-nav .owl-next { right: -30px;}</style> <p><script>jQuery('.owl-carousel').owlCarousel({ loop: true, margin: 10, nav: true, navText: --> "<i class='fa fa-caret-left'></i>", "<i class='fa fa-caret-right'></i>" ], autoplay: false, autoplayHoverPause: false, responsive: { 0: { items: 1 }, 600: { items: 3 }, 1000: { items: 3 } }})</script></p>
