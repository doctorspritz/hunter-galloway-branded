The reasons for this vary from the banks tightening their credit criteria to an increase in loan applications—but the fact is, you need to be more vigilant than ever to make sure your loan doesn’t get declined.</span></p> <h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>The most common reasons we see home loans declined are:</b></span></h2> <ul class="ul1"> <li class="li1"><span class="s1"><strong>⛔️</strong>forgetting credit cards, interest-free loans or even small Afterpay accounts they haven’t used for a while.</span></li> <li class="li1"><span class="s1"><strong>⛔️</strong>changing jobs too frequently—if you have changed jobs multiple times in the past year, this is generally not seen as positive for the lenders.</span></li> <li class="li1"><span class="s1"><strong>⛔️</strong>changing addresses too frequently—again, if you have moved around lots in the past year without any good reason the lenders tend not to like this.</span></li> <li class="li1"><span class="s1"><strong>⛔️</strong>having messy banking situations—having five-plus banks and getting paid into multiple bank accounts, making it hard to track where you are getting paid.</span></li> </ul> <p class="p1"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-8612" src="https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/DO-I-HAVE-A-REAL-PRE-APPROVAL-1-410x1024.png" alt="DO I HAVE A REAL PRE-APPROVAL (1)" width="410" height="1024"></p> <h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>To maximise the chances of getting your home loan approved:</b></span></h2> <ol class="ol1"> <li class="li1"><span class="s1">Check your credit file—At Hunter Galloway we provide a <a href="https://www.mycreditfile.com.au/products-services/my-credit-file"><span class="s2">free credit file check</span></a> to our clients; this report shows all active (and closed) credit cards and loans to make sure this is covered on the loan application.</span></li> <li class="li1"><span class="s1">Double check any outstanding credit card limits—We use a service called <a href="https://bankstatements.com.au/"><span class="s2">BankStatements</span></a> that will connect with your existing internet banking and provide up-to-date credit limits, again making sure no information is lost and maximising your chances of approval.</span></li> <li class="li1"><span class="s1">Clean up your bank accounts—Unfortunately, this is only something you can do; if you are paid into multiple bank accounts or have a bunch of different credit cards try to consolidate <a href="https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/"><span class="s2">using a balance transfer</span></a>, or simply close them down.</span></li> </ol> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">If your home loan does get declined, it’s not the end of the world.
