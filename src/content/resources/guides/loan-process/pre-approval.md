Some real estate agents and vendors won’t actually accept your offer if you don’t have a signed pre-approval offer, so here are our tips for pre-approval.</span></p> <ul class="ul1"> <li class="li1"><span class="s1"><strong>✅ </strong>Sign an application form of a mortgage broker.</span></li> <li class="li1"><span class="s1"><strong>✅ </strong>Provide proof of loans, credit cards, savings, and income.</span></li> <li class="li1"><span class="s1"><strong>✅ </strong>When a mortgage broker completes the preliminary assessment, a number of loan products and lenders will be recommended by them.</span></li> <li class="li1"><span class="s1"><strong>✅ </strong>Once you select a lender, the loan application is submitted to the broker, along with all the documents.</span></li> <li class="li1"><span class="s1"><strong>✅ </strong>The lender evaluates your application and provides a home loan pre-approval.</span></li> </ul> <h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>What Do I Need to Get a Home Loan?</b></span></h2> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">The first step in the home loan application process is the eligibility assessment. The mortgage broker will set up a meeting and assess your current financial situation to find out if you meet the eligibility criteria. They will also discuss your objectives and requirements to find out the best solution for you.</span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">You are required to provide the following list of documents during the application process:</span></p> <ul class="ul1"> <li class="li1"><span class="s1"><strong>✅ </strong>Identity documents, passport and driver’s license</span></li> <li class="li1"><span class="s1"><strong>✅ </strong>Payslips, group certificates</span></li> <li class="li1"><span class="s1"><strong>✅ </strong>Bank account statement</span></li> <li class="li1"><span class="s1"><strong>✅ </strong>Expenses and liabilities account</span></li> <li class="li1"><span class="s1"><strong>✅ </strong>Documents containing asset details, and</span></li> <li class="li1"><span class="s1"><strong>✅ </strong>Contract of sale</span></li> </ul> <p class="p5"><span class="s1"><i>The bank will ask to check your pay account and look for salary credits and loan repayments.</i></span></p> <p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zya9xA-2nmA?feature=oembed&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;rel=0&amp;color=WHITE" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p> <h2 class="p6"><span class="s3"><b>N</b><a href="https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/pre-approval/"><span class="s4"><b>ot all pre-approvals are created equal.</b></span></a></span></h2> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">In most cases a <a href="https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/pre-approval/"><span class="s4">pre-approval</span></a> is just an indication that the bank is okay to consider approving your loan; the bank may just complete a credit check and not check any of your documents and wait until you lodge a full mortgage application to do this.</span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">With some banks, a full mortgage application is only done when you have signed the contract on a purchase property—which is not possible when going to auction. Lenders like this will only verify your payslips, bank statements and income information when they receive this contract of sale, putting you at risk when going to auction because you can’t be 100% sure they can lend you the money.</span></p> <p class="p7"><span class="s1"><b>At Hunter Galloway we work with several lenders who fully verify your documents before issuing a </b><a href="https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/pre-approval/"><span class="s4"><b>pre-approval</b></span></a><b>; this makes a much more reliable approval with fewer conditions when you are buying at auction.</b></span></p> <h2 class="p7"><span class="s1"><b>What Are Some Common Pre-Approval Conditions?</b></span></h2> <p class="p7"><span class="s1">In most cases, a <a href="https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/pre-approval/"><span class="s4">pre-approval</span></a> has conditions that need to be completed before the loan can be unconditionally approved. This is quite common and these range from generic conditions like subject to a bank valuation to specific conditions like getting a letter from your employer confirming your start date. </span></p> <p class="p7"><span class="s1"><b>A few common </b><a href="https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/pre-approval/"><span class="s4"><b>pre-approval</b></span></a><b> conditions include:</b></span></p> <ul class="ul1"> <li class="li1"><span class="s1"><strong>✅ </strong>Our validation of all details provided to ensure they are true and correct</span></li> <li class="li1"><span class="s1"><strong>✅ </strong>Our receipt of all necessary supporting documentation</span></li> <li class="li1"><span class="s1"><strong>✅ </strong>Satisfactory valuation for the proposed security property(s)</span></li> <li class="li1"><span class="s1"><strong>✅ </strong>Lenders mortgage insurance approval, if required</span></li> <li class="li1"><span class="s1"><strong>✅ </strong>No significant change in the customer’s financial position</span></li> </ul> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Aside from understanding you have a reliable pre-approval, it’s important to know what your auction budget should be, what the repayments are going to look like after you’ve bought the property and how much deposit you need.</span></p> <h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>What to Do Once the Application Is Submitted for a Pre-Approval</b></span></h2> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Make sure the loan application is in line with the bank’s policy before you submit it. You can seek the advice of a lender or a mortgage broker to make sure it adheres to the policy and ask the following questions:</span></p> <ul class="ul1"> <li class="li1"><span class="s1">Can I make a bid at the <a href="https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/buying-at-auction/"><span class="s4">auction</span></a>?</span></li> <li class="li1"><span class="s1">Am I required to satisfy conditions before going to the <a href="https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/buying-at-auction/"><span class="s4">auction</span></a> or making an offer?</span></li> <li class="li1"><span class="s1">What are the pre-approval conditions?</span></li> <li class="li1"><span class="s1">Has my application been approved by the lenders mortgage insurer?</span></li> <li class="li1"><span class="s1">Has my application been accepted by the credit department?</span></li> </ul> <p class="p2"><i style="font-size: 18px;">Important reminder: Lending policies and interest rates vary from time to time and are subject to change. So, when you go to an </i><a style="font-size: 18px;" href="https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/buying-at-auction/"><span class="s4"><i>auction</i></span></a><i style="font-size: 18px;">, make sure you are aware of the policies and current rates.</i></p> <p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-9408" src="https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Pre-approval-process-e1548033257623.png" alt="Pre approval process" width="800" height="1780" /></p> <h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Are Pre-Approvals Always Reliable?</b></span></h2> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">First of all, avoid non-written applications or a non-formal application; this includes an application that is submitted over the phone or a quick online application. It is likely that these applications have fewer guarantees and you might end up fulfilling different conditions related to your application at a later date, which will only increase your work.</span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">You are required to submit a formal approval signed by a lender for it to be reliable. This will make it easier for a lender to assess your application. The more conditions you fulfil, the higher your chances are to get a pre-approval.</span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Make sure the following things are done to be able to secure a home loan pre-approval:</span></p> <ul class="ul1"> <li class="li1"><span class="s1"><strong>✅</strong>The lender accepts your loan application after evaluating your financial situation.</span></li> <li class="li1"><span class="s1"><strong>✅</strong>Banks or lenders don’t have to check off too many conditions on the application. If there are things on the application that are yet to be confirmed, ask the bank to confirm it first and then submit your application for approval.</span></li> <li class="li1"><span class="s1"><strong>✅</strong>The pre-approval submitted is for more than what you plan to spend on the property. This way you won’t have to apply for another pre-approval if the budget is revised.</span></li> </ul> <h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Is There Any Difference Between a Pre-Approval and Conditional Approval?</b></span></h2> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Pre-approval is not a complete approval in principle. Once the lender receives your application and supporting documents, they’ll evaluate it to confirm if it is in line with their policy. The approval of an application depends on certain conditions; for example, a bank might accept a property as security against the loan.</span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">A mortgage broker can also help you get a pre-approval on your loan if you haven’t finalised any property yet. It’s only valid for 90 days, but you can get an extension by providing certain documents like salary slip, etc.</span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">In some cases, applicants purchase a property before getting a pre-approval. They sign the agreement of purchase and then apply for a loan. But it’s a risky move as you may end up losing your initial deposit paid to buy a property if you are unable to get a loan.</span></p> <h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>What Is the Difference Between Final Approval (Sometimes Called Unconditional Approval) and Conditional Approval?</b></span></h2> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Once you fulfil all the conditions, the bank will give you unconditional or final approval. This is the final step in securing a loan. It shows that you are guaranteed to receive a loan and your application has been fully approved. Unconditional approval is only reversed if a lender suspects any fraudulent activity or finds any discrepancy that was missed earlier.</span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">If a private vendor accepts your offer or you win in an <a href="https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/buying-at-auction/"><span class="s4">auction</span></a>, you’ll get a grace period of one to three weeks to get your initial deposit and finances in order. During that period, you can check back with your lender to make sure they will honour the contract. Even if you don’t get a grace period, make an inquiry and ask your lender if they will give you approval.</span></p> <p></p> <div class="hub_pr_n_arrows"><i class="fa fa-angle-left" aria-hidden="true"></i></div> <div class="hub_previous">Previous</div> <div class="hub_previous_link"><a href="https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/hub/get-the-right-home-loan/choice/">Choose the right home loan</a></div> <p></p> <div class="hub_pr_n_arrows"><i class="fa fa-angle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i></div> <div class="hub_next">Next</div> <div class="hub_next_link"><a href="https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/hub/get-the-right-home-loan/declined/">Getting your home loan declined isn’t the end of the world</a></div> <p><link rel='stylesheet' href='https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/OwlCarousel2/2.1.3/assets/owl.carousel.min.css'><script src='https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/OwlCarousel2/2.1.3/owl.carousel.min.js'></script><script src='https://use.fontawesome.com/826a7e3dce.js'></script></p> <style>.carousel-wrap { margin: 90px auto; padding: 0 5%; width: 80%; position: relative;}/* fix blank or flashing items on carousel */.owl-carousel .item { position: relative; z-index: 100; -webkit-backface-visibility: hidden; }/* end fix */.owl-nav > div { margin-top: -26px; position: absolute; top: 50%; color: #cdcbcd;}.owl-nav i { font-size: 52px;}.owl-nav .owl-prev { left: -30px;}.owl-nav .owl-next { right: -30px;}</style> <p><script>jQuery('.owl-carousel').owlCarousel({ loop: true, margin: 10, nav: true, navText: --> "<i class='fa fa-caret-left'></i>", "<i class='fa fa-caret-right'></i>" ], autoplay: false, autoplayHoverPause: false, responsive: { 0: { items: 1 }, 600: { items: 3 }, 1000: { items: 3 } }})</script></p>
