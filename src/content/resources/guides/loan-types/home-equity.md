For example, if you bought a house for $300,000 and paid 25 percent as a down payment. The home equity, in this case, will be $75,000 i.e., 25 percent of $300,000. However, if the value of a property increases in future to $500,000, and you still owe $225,000, the overall equity stake will increase from 25 percent to 55 percent.</p> <p>You can use home equity as collateral in an equity loan. The repayment schedule, interest rate, and terms of a home equity loan are normally fixed. With this loan, you can refinance, buy another property, invest in shares, or renovate a house.</p> <p>It allows you to use the equity that has already been paid off. As long as the interest is paid on time, you can redraw any payment previously made. This is why it is suitable for businesses or investors.</p> <p>If you're interested in a home equity loan, our team at Hunter Galloway â€“ <a href="https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/mortgage-broker-brisbane/">Mortgage Broker Brisbane</a> is here to help. <a href="https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/contact/">Contact us</a> for a free assessment.</p> <h3><strong>How Does it Work?</strong></h3> <p>With a home equity loan, you can get a line of credit up to a certain amount against your home loan.

It keeps the borrowing cost low. In addition to that, it also gives you a tax benefit.

However, make sure you hire a tax expert to help you claim this deduction.</p> <p>It provides a certain level of security to lenders as well. The equity portion of the house can be used as a collateral. But despite having a collateral, borrowers should still be mindful of not lending too much.
