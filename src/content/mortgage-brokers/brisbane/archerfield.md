Known for its airport and motorsport complex, it has a predominantly commercial character. The suburb's development is closely tied to its aviation history, with Archerfield Airport serving as a key hub during World War II. Today, it remains an important center for general aviation and pilot training. The area features flat terrain with some light vegetation. Residents are mainly working professionals in industrial sectors. Public transport options include bus services and nearby train stations. Archerfield's industrial focus makes it less suitable for residential living but ideal for businesses and aviation enthusiasts.</p> </div> <div class="suburb-stats"> <div class="stat-item"> <h3>Median House Price</h3> <p>$</p> </div> <div class="stat-item"> <h3>Median Unit Price</h3> <p>$</p> </div> <div class="stat-item"> <h3>Population</h3> </div> </div> </div> </section> <section class="mortgage-services"> <div class="container"> <h2>Our Mortgage Services in</h2> <div class="services-grid"> <div class="service-item"> <h3>First Home Buyers</h3> <p>Navigating the property market as a first-time buyer can be challenging.
