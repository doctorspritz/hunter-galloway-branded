Don’t take that risk. </em></p> <p>Our brokers have seen all sorts of mistakes in the past! With their level of experience, they know problems you may face on your loan application and how to mitigate them when <a href="https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/applying-for-a-mortgage/">applying with a specific bank or lender</a>. We have a wide range of lenders on our panel and our brokers intimately understand their credit policies.</p> <p>We can do this through our own internal credit assessment process which we complete before applying with any lender. Our team has its own internal Credit Manager who reviews each application before being submitted to the lenders, meaning we won’t apply with a lender who won’t approve your loan.</p> <ul> <li style="text-align: left;"><strong>✅ Phone: <a href="tel:1300088065">1300 088 065</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/contact/">✅ Contact us here</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/free-assessment/">✅ Book A Free Assessment</a></strong></li> </ul> <h2><strong>Why do I need a broker if I can get a loan through my bank?</strong></h2> <p>We take extra time up front to go through your full situation and provide a complete lending solution.</p> <p>You might have a situation where your bank will approve a loan for you to buy a block of land and then not approve the construction loan when its time to construct a house on it!</p> <p>Our brokers will look at your needs now and into the future, to make sure you have the best possible loan that looks after all of your needs.</p> <h2><strong>What is a mortgage broker?</strong></h2> <p>A mortgage broker is a consultant that can help you with finding a home loan, or mortgage usually from their panel of lenders. Once the right home loan has been selected, the mortgage broker will help you manage the home loan process, from initially signing the paperwork all the way until settlement.</p> <h2><strong>What does a mortgage broker do?</strong></h2> <p>A mortgage broker acts on your behalf to arrange a home loan through a bank or lender. Australian banks and lenders have different policies and loan requirements, and it is a brokers job to find a loan from one of these parties that fit with your individual situation.</p> <p>Mortgage Brokers can help find the right home loan for any situation, from purchasing your first home to buying an investment property all the way to refinancing your mortgage to a better interest rate.</p> <p>At <a href="https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/">Hunter Galloway</a> we have access to over 30 different banks and lenders, giving you a wide range of home loan options to ensure we have a lender that can fit in with what you need.</p> <h2><strong>How much does it cost to use a broker and your services?</strong></h2> <p><a href="https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/home-loans-brisbane/">Our services</a> are completely free for all home and investment loans. We get paid by the lenders for doing the work, collating your loan application and meeting with you that otherwise would be done by a bank manager or branch lender so you get access to the same rates as if you went to the lender directly.</p> <p>The advantage for you is that unlike when dealing with one bank, we can help you work with a wider variety of lenders and get the best options that work for you choosing from our panel of over 30 banks and lenders!</p> <h2><strong>How do brokers get paid? </strong></h2> <p>Mortgage brokers in Brisbane get paid commissions from the banks, we do the same work the branch manager would do in putting together your loan application – except we are invested in your loan application and will work very hard to get it approved, as well as provide incredible service.</p> <p>As our team at <a href="https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/">Hunter Galloway</a> are mortgage broking and credit experts we can answer all of your questions instead of directing you to another department.</p> <h2><strong>FBAA &amp; Credit and Investments Ombudsman Membership </strong></h2> <p>As members of the <a href="https://www.fbaa.com.au/">Financial Brokers Association of Australia (FBAA)</a> and the <a href="https://www.cio.org.au">Credit and Investments Ombudsman (CIO)</a> we must uphold the highest level of excellence when helping clients with their finances. The members of each organisation must meet a minimum standard in experience, education and ongoing training to maintain membership each year and as active members, we commit to upholding these standards, ensuring we maintain their high levels of compliance, integrity, and professionalism with all of our mortgage clients.</p> <h2><strong>What types of customers do you help?</strong></h2> <p>Our mission is to make your home loan application effortless.

Banks, solicitors, valuers, different online systems, the list goes on!</p> <p>Before you start talking to your bank you have your mortgage broker, their aggregator and software provider – just to prepare and lodge your application!</p> <p>When your file reaches the bank’s system they will instruct a valuation management company, like Valex or VMS who then instruct subcontracting valuers to inspect the company, as well as obtain a copy of your credit report from the credit reporting bureau.</p> <p>If you have less than a 20% deposit (or are borrowing more than 80% of the properties value) then the bank will also need to get approval for your loan from the mortgage insurers – who have the final say on the application.</p> <p>Once your loan has been approved the banks often use solicitors to prepare the loan offer and contracts, as well a separate settlement agent to arranger cheques and fund your loan.</p> <p>We help cut out all the noise in the process, we deal with the banks and third parties on your behalf – and always keep you in the loop.</p> <h2><strong>Valuation issues &amp; credit scores </strong></h2> <p>One of the most common issues we see is with valuations and shortfalls which can ultimately stop your property journey before it even begins. We can order free upfront valuations with many of our lenders, meaning we can find out what your bank thinks your property is worth way before applying with them.</p> <p>From experience, we know that ordering a valuation prior to applying for a home loan makes sure your credit file doesn’t get damaged from having multiple enquiries.</p> <p>We can provide free valuations and also a copy of your credit file so you know where you stand way before applying for a loan with the banks!</p> <p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-7443 size-medium" title="Mortgage Broker Brisbane" src="https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/mortgage-broker-brisbane-1-300x210.jpg" alt="mortgage broker brisbane" width="300" height="210" /></p> <h2><strong>Complex Credit Policy Pitfalls </strong></h2> <p>Each lender and bank in Australia has a unique credit policy, meaning while some will accept your full income, others may not allow it due to their policy.</p> <p>Quite often bank policy can be set in stone, and due to the complexity bank staff quite honestly don’t know it nor do many mortgage broker Brisbane. They are not familiar with complex situations and how to correctly assess them. This can sometimes cause it to take quite a long time to process your application and even in some instances mean your loan will get declined for no good reason.</p> <p>With banks making their policies more and more complex it becomes more important to correctly package, and asses your application before it is even lodged with the bank – showing the banks all of the strengths of your home loan application and making sure it fits all of their policies.</p> <p>At <a href="https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/">Hunter Galloway</a> we have our own in-house credit team and we make sure your application is going to fit with the bank each time.</p> <h2><strong>What is an Independent Mortgage Broker?</strong></h2> <p>An Independent Mortgage Broker in Brisbane is someone that is not subjected to outside authority in other words, they should only be working under a fee for service model and not be paid commissions by the banks.</p> <p>The majority of Mortgage and Finance Brokers across Australia are not technically independent, and it is fairly uncommon in Australia to have financially independent mortgage brokers because in the past they have proven to be financially unstable due to having a longer turn around time and very limited bank options.</p> <p><a href="https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/">Hunter Galloway</a> is an independently owned Mortgage Broker, we use Connective Financial services as our aggregator who provide the latest technology and training to help find our customers the best finance options. We are not owned by a bank, and operate under the belief that <em>clients come first</em>, using our team of experts we will find the best finance solution for you.</p> <h2><strong>Why should I use a mortgage broker in Brisbane? </strong></h2> <p>The best mortgage brokers can help you through their intimate knowledge of credit policy, making the home loan process quick, easy and stress-free.</p> <p>We work with a wide range of borrowers, from <a href="https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/first-home-buyer-loans/">first home owners</a>, <a href="https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/property-investor-portfolio/">experienced property investors</a> to <a href="https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/home-loans-for-doctors/">medical professionals</a> helping them find the best deal.</p> <p>Through our intimate bank credit knowledge, we can find ‘secret’ policy exceptions to get approvals for applications that would normally get declined, including no deposit <a href="https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/guarantor-home-loan/">guarantor home loans</a> and <a href="https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/unusual-employment-loan/">unusual employment loans</a>.</p> <p>We also have very strong relationships with the credit teams and key staff at the banks meaning we are also in a good position to get the very best interest rates for you. Often this means a cheaper variable or fixed interest rates, or rebates from the bank to cover the costs to <a href="https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/refinance-home-loan/">refinance your loan</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Why choose us?</strong></h2> <p>Our focus is on taking the stress out of the home loan process.</p> <p>We are different from a lot of traditional mortgage brokers who are one person operations.
