## Where do I start?

Getting your first home loan doesn't have to be overwhelming. Here's your complete checklist:

### 1. Check Your Credit Score

Your credit score impacts:
- **Loan approval** chances
- **Interest rates** you'll receive
- **Borrowing capacity**

Get your free credit report from Equifax or Experian. Scores above 600 are generally acceptable.

### 2. Calculate Your Borrowing Power

Use our [borrowing power calculator](/calculators/borrowing-power) to estimate:
- Maximum loan amount
- Required deposit
- Monthly repayments

Most lenders require:
- **5-20% deposit** (less with LMI)
- **Genuine savings** history
- **Stable income** for 6+ months

### 3. First Home Owner Grant (FHOG)

Queensland's FHOG offers **$30,000** for:
- New homes under $750,000
- First-time buyers only
- Owner-occupied properties
