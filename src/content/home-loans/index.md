If so, there are a number of things you have to understand before finalising any home loan package, including the type of home loan, fixed and variable nature of home loans, fees, and other features.</p> <div id="attachment_8134" style="width: 736px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8134" class="size-full wp-image-8134" src="https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/brisbane-property-options.jpg" alt="brisbane property options" width="726" height="484" /><p id="caption-attachment-8134" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Finding the right home loan is the first step on the path to owning your own home.</em></p></div> <h2><strong>Types of Loans</strong></h2> <p>It’s important to understand different types of loans because when it comes to finding the <u>right home loan</u> package when buying a house, this information will help you make the right decision</p> <ul> <li><strong>✅ Basic Loan </strong>– This home loan type only offers a few features and has a low-interest It will not be a suitable option for those who want to make additional repayments.</li> <li><strong>✅ Standard Loan</strong> – This loan type offers more flexibility compared to a basic loan. With the standard home loan, you can redraw the money you have paid in and can also switch to a variable rate. In fact, it also allows you to divide the loan into the fixed and variable loan.</li> <li><strong>✅ Home Loan Package </strong>– This loan type is cheaper compared to a basic loan type. With this loan type, you get a free transaction account and you are not even required to have an annual fee credit card.</li> </ul> <p style="text-align:center;"><a href="javascript:void(0)" alt="" class="btn_yellow rc_open on_page" style="margin: 0 auto;margin-top:20px;">Get a Free Assessment</a></p> <h2><strong>Fixed vs Variable Loan</strong></h2> <p>In addition to knowing about different types of loans available in the market, you must also be aware of the nature of different loan types. This is very important, especially if you want to find the right home loan package.</p> <p>In a fixed rate home loan, the interest rate remains fixed throughout the terms of the loan, whereas, in a variable rate home loan, the rate changes in accordance with the change in market interest rates.</p> <p>With a fixed rate home loan, you can stick to your budget without worrying about incorporating the rate fluctuation, but in times of low interest rates, you would be stuck with paying a high-interest repayment. Therefore, when you plan to choose the right home loan, make sure that you keep this in mind as it will allow you to make the right decision for your financial goals.</p> <div id="attachment_8539" style="width: 737px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8539" class="size-full wp-image-8539" src="https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/fixed-vs-variable-home-loans-for-contract-income-1.png" alt="fixed vs variable home loans for contract income" width="727" height="524" /><p id="caption-attachment-8539" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Fixed and variable rates both have their advantages and disadvantages.</em></p></div> <h2><strong>Fees Involved</strong></h2> <p>Interest repayments are not the only cost you have to bear when applying for a home loan, there are other fees involved as well, such as establishment fees, valuation cost, inspection cost, and more. Do not hesitate to ask the lender about all the fees included in a home loan. Asking the right questions will eventually lead to the right home loan package.</p> <p>Let’s take a look at some of the fees involved:</p> <ul> <li><strong>✅ Break cost </strong>– When it comes to loans at a fixed rate, they can have high exit fees, especially if the variable rate is lower. If you want to get out of this home loan, you are required to make up for all the lost interest that could be earned by the bank if you had paid higher interest rates till the end of the term. This is known as the break cost.</li> <li><strong>✅ Annual or Monthly Fee</strong> – This is an ongoing fee, and is paid on a regular basis. However, the monthly and annual fees also are a contributing factor in deciding how soon will you be able to pay back the loan.</li> <li><strong>✅ Lender’s Mortgage Insurance (LMI) </strong>– This cost is charged by the lender to ensure themselves should the borrower default on a loan. It is normally charged if you have less than 20 per cent of a deposit.</li> <li><strong>✅ Valuation fees </strong>– This is a fee charged by a lender for the property valuation. You may have to bear this cost even if the loan does not get approved. Inquire whether you meet the requirements for the loan before submitting an application.</li> <li><strong>✅ Application fees </strong>– Lenders can also ask for an upfront application fee and an establishment fee. You can talk to your bank and seek a discount or ask them to waive it altogether.</li> </ul> <p>Being aware of these charges is very important for you to be able to find the right home loan. It will help you prepare yourself beforehand to be able to meet all the financial responsibilities that come with finding the right home loan in Brisbane.</p> <p class="testm_header">Hunter Galloway Mortgage Brokers have helped <strong>hundreds of home owners.</strong></p> <p class="testm_top">communication was superb and the whole process was hassle free…</p> <p class="testm_text">We have dealt through Mortgage Choice and also directly with CUA and your service was better than our previous experiences.
