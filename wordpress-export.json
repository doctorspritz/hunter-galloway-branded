It&#8217;s also worth noting that life insurance premiums tend to be lower the younger and healthier you are, so buying a policy earlier in life could potentially save you money in the long run.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-toggle-item\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"elementor-tab-title-1892\" class=\"elementor-tab-title\" data-tab=\"2\" role=\"button\" aria-controls=\"elementor-tab-content-1892\" aria-expanded=\"false\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"elementor-toggle-icon elementor-toggle-icon-left\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"elementor-toggle-icon-closed\"><i class=\"fas fa-caret-right\"></i></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"elementor-toggle-icon-opened\"><i class=\"elementor-toggle-icon-opened fas fa-caret-up\"></i></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"elementor-toggle-title\" tabindex=\"0\">How Much Does Life Insurance Cost in Australia?</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"elementor-tab-content-1892\" class=\"elementor-tab-content elementor-clearfix\" data-tab=\"2\" role=\"region\" aria-labelledby=\"elementor-tab-title-1892\"><p>The cost of life insurance in Australia can vary widely based on several factors including your age, health, lifestyle, occupation, and the amount of coverage you want.

A longer benefit period means higher premiums, but it also provides more protection if you can&#8217;t return to work for an extended period.</p><p> </p><h4>Percentage of Income Covered</h4><p>Policies typically cover up to 75% of your income, but the exact amount can vary. Be sure to choose a level of cover that will meet your needs.</p><p> </p><h4>Policy Terms and Exclusions</h4><p>Understand the terms and conditions of your policy, including any exclusions or limitations.</p><p> </p><p>Income Protection Insurance is a significant consideration for anyone earning an income. It offers peace of mind and financial stability in unexpected circumstances. To get a policy that best suits your needs, consider consulting with experts such as Hunter Galloway for personalised advice.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-b08e49b elementor-widget elementor-widget-spacer\" data-id=\"b08e49b\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"spacer.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-spacer\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-spacer-inner\"></div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-a672659 e-flex e-con-boxed e-con e-parent\" data-id=\"a672659\" data-element_type=\"container\" data-settings=\"{&quot;background_background&quot;:&quot;classic&quot;}\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"e-con-inner\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-2b7575d elementor-widget elementor-widget-heading\" data-id=\"2b7575d\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"heading.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-xl\">Income Protection Insurance FAQs</h2>\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-8a80a60 elementor-widget elementor-widget-spacer\" data-id=\"8a80a60\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"spacer.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-spacer\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-spacer-inner\"></div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-41a11fc elementor-widget elementor-widget-toggle\" data-id=\"41a11fc\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"toggle.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-toggle\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-toggle-item\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"elementor-tab-title-6881\" class=\"elementor-tab-title\" data-tab=\"1\" role=\"button\" aria-controls=\"elementor-tab-content-6881\" aria-expanded=\"false\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"elementor-toggle-icon elementor-toggle-icon-left\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"elementor-toggle-icon-closed\"><i class=\"fas fa-caret-right\"></i></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"elementor-toggle-icon-opened\"><i class=\"elementor-toggle-icon-opened fas fa-caret-up\"></i></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"elementor-toggle-title\" tabindex=\"0\">What Does Income Protection Insurance Cover?</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"elementor-tab-content-6881\" class=\"elementor-tab-content elementor-clearfix\" data-tab=\"1\" role=\"region\" aria-labelledby=\"elementor-tab-title-6881\"><p>Income Protection Insurance is designed to provide a replacement income if you&#8217;re unable to work due to illness or injury.

For example, a retail business may require public liability and property insurance, while a consulting firm may need professional indemnity cover.</p><h4>Level of Coverage</h4><p>Your level of coverage should be sufficient to cover significant risks without being unnecessarily high. Balance your coverage to ensure you&#8217;re adequately protected without overpaying.</p><h4>Policy Exclusions</h4><p>Review the policy exclusions carefully. These are the situations in which your insurer won&#8217;t pay a claim.</p><h4>Premium Affordability</h4><p>Consider the cost of premiums in relation to your business budget. An overly expensive policy could create financial strain.</p><p> </p><p>Selecting the right business insurance requires a good understanding of your business&#8217;s unique risks and requirements. For personalised advice that takes your business needs into account, consider consulting with an experienced broker like Hunter Galloway.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-2b6fd61 elementor-widget elementor-widget-spacer\" data-id=\"2b6fd61\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"spacer.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-spacer\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-spacer-inner\"></div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-1cbc743 e-flex e-con-boxed e-con e-parent\" data-id=\"1cbc743\" data-element_type=\"container\" data-settings=\"{&quot;background_background&quot;:&quot;classic&quot;}\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"e-con-inner\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-10d6d5c elementor-widget elementor-widget-heading\" data-id=\"10d6d5c\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"heading.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-xl\">Business Insurance FAQs</h2>\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-53fc0eb elementor-widget elementor-widget-spacer\" data-id=\"53fc0eb\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"spacer.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-spacer\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-spacer-inner\"></div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-5f9ce43 elementor-widget elementor-widget-toggle\" data-id=\"5f9ce43\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"toggle.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-toggle\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-toggle-item\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"elementor-tab-title-1001\" class=\"elementor-tab-title\" data-tab=\"1\" role=\"button\" aria-controls=\"elementor-tab-content-1001\" aria-expanded=\"false\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"elementor-toggle-icon elementor-toggle-icon-left\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"elementor-toggle-icon-closed\"><i class=\"fas fa-caret-right\"></i></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"elementor-toggle-icon-opened\"><i class=\"elementor-toggle-icon-opened fas fa-caret-up\"></i></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"elementor-toggle-title\" tabindex=\"0\">What Type of Business Insurance Do I Need?</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"elementor-tab-content-1001\" class=\"elementor-tab-content elementor-clearfix\" data-tab=\"1\" role=\"region\" aria-labelledby=\"elementor-tab-title-1001\"><p>The type of business insurance you need depends on the nature of your business, the industry you&#8217;re in, and the specific risks associated with your operations.

They were so approachable, patient, and they explained everything in a way that was really easy to understand.  Even despite the rate hikes in the last few months, as scary as the media made it out to be, I was assured that I'd be in a good position to borrow and be financially comfortable while living in first home - and that I am 🙂\n\nI would definitely recommend Hunter Galloway to anybody, especially people like myself who are especially new to the process.

build wealth and get some passive income, so they can <b>retire comfortably and escape the rat race. </b></p><p>When I first started working with property investors, I never realised how open people would really be.</p><p>I&#8217;d walk into the meeting room with my client, and start chatting about what they are looking to achieve.  They&#8217;d start talking&#8230;</p><p>About their frustrations with the property market, how hard it is to know who to trust for the right information, and the feeling like they&#8217;re <b>always one step behind the professional investors.</b></p><p>I&#8217;d give them my advice on how to start &#8211; do your own due diligence and narrow down your shortlist for investment to one or two promising suburbs. Once you&#8217;ve done that, the rest of the process is pretty straightforward.  </p><p>Some of them would smile and nod, but I could tell that they weren&#8217;t ready to take ownership of their property investment goals.</p><p>They&#8217;d tell me, &#8220;it&#8217;s not that easy&#8221;, or they&#8217;d have an excuse as to why this strategy wouldn&#8217;t work for them. I knew that I&#8217;d likely never see them again.</p><p>But <b>others would sit up, pay attention, and they&#8217;d ask me for specifics:</b></p><p><em>&#8220;What&#8217;s the best way to do my own research?&#8221; </em></p><p><em>&#8220;Where&#8217;s the best place to get property market data?&#8221;</em></p><p><em>&#8220;What kind of metrics should I be focusing on?&#8221;</em></p><p>And the questions wouldn&#8217;t stop there. After the meeting, they&#8217;d send me emails about potential suburbs and ask me for my thoughts.</p><p>They&#8217;d keep me posted on their progress as they worked through their process.</p><p><b>I knew that those people would eventually build the financial freedom that they had dreamed of.  Why?</b></p><p>Because in between meetings, I&#8217;d browse my emails. And <em>on the same days</em> that I&#8217;d have those meetings, I&#8217;d get thank-you emails from my clients, who&#8217;d casually mention that they used my advice to seek out and secure an investment property in an up-and-coming suburb.</p><p>One that wasn&#8217;t on the latest &#8220;top suburbs to invest in&#8221; piece from one of the dozens of investment blogs on the internet, but one that they&#8217;d found by doing their own due diligence. </p><p>And within the space of 6 or 12 months,<b> their property&#8217;s value had increased by 5 or 10%</b> &#8211; and this is <em>before </em>the wild times that we saw in 2020-2022.</p><p>Not to mention, they were getting<b> rental yields well above 5%.</b> </p><p>Hmm. Some people were complaining that they couldn&#8217;t get a leg up in the property market&#8230; while others were routinely outperforming the market &#8211; not just once, but multiple times. </p><p>It was like I had a little window into the minds of aspiring investors. Investing in property <em>is</em> tough &#8211; but <b>some people seemed to achieve success <em>despite</em> their challenges.</b></p><p>So I became obsessed with studying what makes the difference between someone who <em>talks about</em> investing in property versus someone who <em>actually takes action. </em> </p><p>Look, I could tell you about all of the ambitions that everyone has about investing in property, like how they are going to build a 10-property portfolio in 3 years and retire at the age of 35. </p><p>Although, since this is Australia, you&#8217;ve probably heard these stories from one of your mates or at a family barbecue. </p><p>I could tell you about all of the odd things these people do, like how they <em>obsess</em> over what their property &#8220;guru&#8221; is saying about the market instead of digging down and doing their research. </p><p>I could tell you how they justify holding off on investing for &#8220;just another few months, until I know which way the market is heading&#8221; when<b> other people are out there buying properties and building wealth.</b></p><p>I could tell you how they gradually stop bringing it up in conversations. They used to get excited about being a property mogul, but now when their friends start talking about property, they just change the topic. </p><p>But I&#8217;d rather just <em>show</em> you.</p><p>Here&#8217;s an email I recently got:</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-357852c elementor-widget elementor-widget-image\" data-id=\"357852c\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"image.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"780\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/property-investor-email-1.png\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-image-67932\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/property-investor-email-1.png 780w, https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/property-investor-email-1-480x164.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 780px, 100vw\" />\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-86b4bae elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"86b4bae\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Nice!

One of the key drivers of growth is expected to be population growth, particularly in major urban centers like Sydney and Melbourne, which will continue to drive demand for housing.</p>\n<p>Another factor contributing to price growth is low interest rates, which are likely to remain at historically low levels for the foreseeable future. This has the effect of making borrowing more affordable and increasing the purchasing power of buyers, which in turn increases demand and drives up prices.</p>\n<p>However, there are also a number of factors that could potentially dampen price growth over the next five years. One of these is the potential for oversupply in some markets, particularly in apartment buildings, which could lead to downward pressure on prices.</p>\n<p>Another potential factor is changes to government policy, such as the removal or reduction of existing incentives for first home buyers. This could reduce demand for properties and lead to a slowdown in price growth.</p>\n<p>Overall, the outlook for the Australian property market in 2023 and beyond is positive, with a number of factors expected to contribute to price growth. However, as with any market, there are also potential risks and challenges that could impact price growth over the medium to long term.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-fb4f5f2 elementor-widget elementor-widget-heading\" data-id=\"fb4f5f2\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"heading.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">Government Incentives</h3>\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-ae1d78d elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"ae1d78d\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Australia has a number of government incentives in place to assist first home buyers. The most well-known of these is the First Home Owner Grant (FHOG), which provides a one-time payment to eligible first home buyers. The amount of the grant varies depending on the state or territory, but can range from $10,000 to $20,000.</p><p>In addition to the FHOG, first home buyers may also be eligible for stamp duty concessions or exemptions, which can further reduce the cost of purchasing a property. For example, in New South Wales, first home buyers are exempt from paying stamp duty on properties up to $650,000, and receive a discount on properties up to $800,000.</p><p>These incentives can have a significant impact on the property market, particularly in areas where demand from first home buyers is high. The increased demand can lead to an increase in property prices, as buyers compete for limited supply. This is particularly evident in markets where the incentives are most generous, such as in regional areas where the FHOG may be higher.</p><p>However, the impact of government incentives on property prices can be difficult to predict, as other factors such as interest rates and economic conditions also play a significant role. Ultimately, the effectiveness of these incentives in promoting home ownership will depend on a range of factors, including affordability, availability of housing stock, and the level of demand from first home buyers.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-0c450a3 elementor-widget elementor-widget-heading\" data-id=\"0c450a3\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"heading.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">Availability of credit</h3>\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-83be101 elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"83be101\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The availability of credit for home loan borrowers in Australia has been affected by a number of factors in recent years, including changes to lending standards, regulatory intervention, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2018, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) introduced measures designed to strengthen lending standards and reduce risk in the banking sector, which led to a tightening of credit availability.</p><p>However, in response to the economic impact of the pandemic, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) implemented a range of measures to stimulate the economy, including cutting interest rates and providing support to the banking sector. This has helped to ease credit availability, with many lenders offering competitive interest rates and more flexible lending criteria.</p><p>Looking to the near future, there are a number of trends that are likely to impact the availability of credit for home loan borrowers in Australia. One of these is the ongoing impact of the pandemic, which has created a degree of uncertainty in the economic environment. This could lead to a tightening of credit availability if lenders become more cautious about the risk of defaults.</p><p>Another trend is the increasing use of technology in the lending process, with many lenders now offering online applications and automated approval processes. This has the potential to make the lending process more efficient and streamlined, which could lead to greater credit availability for borrowers.</p><p>Overall, the availability of credit for home loan borrowers in Australia is likely to remain influenced by a range of factors in the near future, including economic conditions, regulatory intervention, and the ongoing evolution of technology in the lending sector.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-8050db4 elementor-widget elementor-widget-heading\" data-id=\"8050db4\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"heading.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">Interest rate trends</h3>\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-cc223f7 elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"cc223f7\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The recent hike in policy interest rates by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) to 3.35% on 6 February 2023 could have significant implications for property investors. Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive, which can lead to reduced demand for property and, in turn, slower property price growth. This may be a cause for concern for property investors who are relying on capital gains to increase the value of their portfolios.</p><p>The RBA&#8217;s decision to raise interest rates was driven by concerns over rising inflation, which has been running at over 30-year highs. This may lead to further interest rate hikes in the future, which could further impact property investors. However, it is uncertain whether the bank will continue with its aggressive monetary policy long-term, as this will depend on a range of factors including economic conditions and inflation trends.</p><p>Overall, property investors should be aware of the impact that rising interest rates may have on their investments. While higher interest rates may lead to slower property price growth, they can also help to control inflation and promote a more stable economic environment in the long-term.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-57834f5 elementor-widget elementor-widget-heading\" data-id=\"57834f5\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"heading.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">Consumer Confidence</h3>\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-6314251 elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"6314251\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>In February.

Concerns about personal finances and major household item purchases contributed to the decline in confidence, and all five mainland states experienced a decrease in confidence.</p><p>The report indicates that consumer confidence has a significant impact on the property market, as low confidence may lead to reduced demand for property and slower price growth. The decline in consumer confidence may be driven by concerns about rising inflation and the potential for further interest rate hikes.

The latest ABS statistics show that in January 2023, the unemployment rate remained at a low 3.5%, indicating a strong labour market. However, the participation rate decreased to 66.5%, which may reflect a decrease in confidence among jobseekers.</p><p>Employment increased to 13,753,200, while the employment to population ratio decreased to 64.2%. This suggests that while there are more jobs available, a smaller proportion of the population is currently employed. Additionally, the underemployment rate remained at 6.1%, indicating that many Australians may be working part-time or in jobs that do not fully utilize their skills and qualifications.</p><p>Overall, the strength of the labour market is likely to have a positive impact on the property market, as more people are able to enter the market and secure mortgages. However, the decrease in the participation rate and employment to population ratio may indicate that some Australians are struggling to find meaningful employment, which could impact their ability to enter the property market.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</section>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-section elementor-top-section elementor-element elementor-element-967520a elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default\" data-id=\"967520a\" data-element_type=\"section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-top-column elementor-element elementor-element-efe359a\" data-id=\"efe359a\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-0e8404e elementor-widget elementor-widget-spacer\" data-id=\"0e8404e\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"spacer.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-spacer\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-spacer-inner\"></div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-578d236 elementor-widget elementor-widget-heading\" data-id=\"578d236\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"heading.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">The Brisbane Property Market</h2>\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-7257e45 elementor-widget elementor-widget-heading\" data-id=\"7257e45\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"heading.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">Overall Outlook</h2>\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-3904fa3 elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"3904fa3\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The Brisbane property market is expected to experience a reset in 2023, reaching a trough before the next property cycle begins. While there may be a temporary decline in property prices due to interest rate hikes, the long-term fundamentals of the market are strong. Hosting the 2032 Olympics will ensure that Brisbane experiences strong infrastructure growth, economic growth, and population growth over the next decade. Federal government forecasts suggest that Queensland’s population is expected to grow by more than 16 per cent by the time Brisbane hosts the Olympic Games in 2032. This will attract overseas migrants as well as plentiful jobs for highly paid knowledge workers. The top three factors driving the property market in 2023 are affordability, population growth, and the economy and job market. While there may be declines in the Brisbane property market, careful property selection will be critical. Overall, the Brisbane property market is expected to continue performing strongly in the long term, creating a window of opportunity for investors to get into the market before it picks up again.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-4c8d960 elementor-widget elementor-widget-heading\" data-id=\"4c8d960\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"heading.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">Affordability</h3>\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-4eb15e7 elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"4eb15e7\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The affordability of the Brisbane property market is influenced by several factors. The most obvious factor is the supply of houses available in a given market. Planning restrictions, population growth, lending, and government policy also play a role in determining affordability.</p><p>Brisbane&#8217;s cheapest suburb is Ellen Grove, with a median house price of $445,000. Strathpine is another affordable suburb with a median house price of $445,000 and units priced at $266,000.</p><p>Rental yields are decent at 4.6% for houses and higher for units at 6.3%.</p><p>Brisbane&#8217;s housing market has seen a steep annual climb in 2021, with the city&#8217;s property market experiencing a once-in-a-generation property boom resulting in almost 400 suburbs joining the million-dollar club.</p><p>However, the decline in property prices began in January 2023, with Brisbane recording the largest property price decline on record, falling 10.9% in seven months.</p><p>While Brisbane property values are likely to fall further in 2023, it is possible that the rate of decline will continue to slow over the coming months.</p><p>With low vacancy rates, rising interstate migration, and record-high prices, Brisbane is one of the country&#8217;s most in-demand rental markets. September was the fifth consecutive quarter where rent prices rose, according to Domain&#8217;s Rent Report.</p><p>This has led to a shift toward suburbs further afield, as families look for greater affordability with good access to schools, parks, and nature. Middle and outer ring suburbs such as Mount Ommaney, Cornubia, and Fig Tree Pocket all saw significant rent rises up to 20%.</p><p>Overall, the Brisbane property market is driven by multiple factors, including interest rates, domestic migration, relative affordability, and strong rental returns. The top end of the market is seeing the largest gains, with spacious family homes proving the most popular.</p><p>With the recent announcement of Brisbane winning the 2032 Olympic games, there is a perfect storm of positive growth drivers that will see Brisbane&#8217;s house prices continue to perform strongly going forward.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-77a15ae elementor-widget elementor-widget-heading\" data-id=\"77a15ae\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"heading.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">Population growth</h3>\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-027b6a7 elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"027b6a7\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>According to the United Nations population projections, the current metro area population of Brisbane in 2023 is expected to be 2,505,000, which is a 1.33% increase from 2022. Brisbane&#8217;s population is projected to reach 2.834 million by the end of June 2023. The forecast growth rates suggest that 50.06% of Queenslanders will be living in the capital by 2032-33, with Brisbane being home to 3.082 million people. As the population grows, more people need a place to live, which drives increased demand for housing and results in a strong property market. Hosting the 2032 Olympics will ensure that Brisbane is put on the global map and has unique lifestyle and economic benefits that will attract overseas migrants as well as plentiful jobs for highly paid knowledge workers.</p><p>Brisbane&#8217;s property market experienced a flat patch in 2022, but the long-term fundamentals are strong, creating a window of opportunity to get into the property market before it picks up again. While Brisbane&#8217;s house prices saw the steepest annual climb in 13 years in 2021, annual growth tipped into the red at -6.4% in January 2023, and that number can be expected to drop further as gains from the first half of 2022 begin to slip away. While Brisbane property values are likely to fall further in 2023, it is possible that the rate of decline will continue to slow over the coming months.</p><p>The recent announcement of Brisbane winning the 2032 Olympic games will underpin strong infrastructure growth, economic growth, and population growth over the next decade. Anyone who buys an A-grade home or investment-grade property in Brisbane now will look back in a couple of years&#8217; time and recognize they bought a bargain, as the Brisbane market is likely to reach a floor in 2023, and then the next property cycle will begin. Rather than trying to time your next property purchase based on where we are in the cycle, take a long view, and if your income is secure and the time is right for you, this may be an ideal time to get a foothold in the Brisbane property market while others are sitting on the sidelines.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-14ebdac elementor-widget elementor-widget-heading\" data-id=\"14ebdac\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"heading.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">Economy and job market</h3>\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-1a205c1 elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"1a205c1\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The outlook for the Brisbane economy and job market in 2023 and beyond is positive. Brisbane is expected to be a growth market in 2023 due to population growth, a strong economy, and infrastructure spending generating economic activity, jobs, and demand for real estate. The city has all the major ingredients for upward movement in property values, including strength in the underlying economy, a high level of spending on infrastructure, and the biggest population boost from internal migration of anywhere in Australia.</p><p>Hosting the 2032 Olympics will ensure that Brisbane is put on the global map and it has a unique lifestyle and economic benefits that will attract overseas migrants as well as plentiful jobs for highly paid knowledge workers. Federal government forecasts suggest that Queensland’s population is expected to grow by more than 16 per cent by the time Brisbane hosts the Olympic Games in 2032. Despite some sections of the Brisbane market currently struggling, the future for the city, its economy, and its property markets looks positive.</p><p>The Brisbane economy is being underpinned by major projects like Queen’s Wharf, HS Wharf, TradeCoast, Cross River Rail, the second airport runway, and the Adani Coal Mine, but jobs growth from these won’t really kick off for a few more years. Wage growth is expected to fall back to 3.6 per cent in 2024 as the economy weakens and as an increase in immigration helps fill labor. Greater Brisbane is expected to grow faster than the rest of Queensland, with a rate of 1.9 per cent projected for the capital in 2022-23. Based on data from the Department of Jobs and Small Business over the five years to May 2023, the projected employment growth for construction is set to increase.</p><p>In summary, the Brisbane economy and job market are expected to continue growing in 2023 and beyond, driven by population growth, infrastructure spending, and major projects. While there may be some short-term fluctuations, the long-term fundamentals are strong, creating a window of opportunity to get into the property market before the Brisbane market picks up again.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</section>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-section elementor-top-section elementor-element elementor-element-49ae37c elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default\" data-id=\"49ae37c\" data-element_type=\"section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-top-column elementor-element elementor-element-f5bbc19\" data-id=\"f5bbc19\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-f7cc69f elementor-widget elementor-widget-spacer\" data-id=\"f7cc69f\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"spacer.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-spacer\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-spacer-inner\"></div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-eadf2ea elementor-widget elementor-widget-heading\" data-id=\"eadf2ea\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"heading.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">1.

The suburb&#8217;s low vacancy rate of 0.38% means that there is a low chance of properties sitting empty, resulting in shorter vacancy periods between tenants. This is good news for investors as it reduces the risk of lost income from vacant properties. Additionally, the 34-day market period is a sign of good demand, which will have an upward effect on prices, benefiting investors who want to see capital growth in their properties.</p><p>The low stock on the market of 0.42% is another positive indicator for property investors. It means that properties in Ashgrove are being snapped up quickly, indicating a high level of demand from buyers and renters. This is good news for investors who want to ensure that their properties are rented out quickly and for a good price.</p><p>In terms of rental returns, Ashgrove offers a gross rental yield of 4.52%, which is a good return and will make it attractive to investors seeking rental income. The suburb&#8217;s 7.06% rental growth rate is also a positive sign of sustainable rental demand, indicating that rental prices are likely to continue to rise, providing investors with a reliable source of rental income.</p><p>While Ashgrove&#8217;s long-term growth rate of 1.71% is below the median, this leaves room for the suburb to catch up to the rest of the market, making it a potentially lucrative investment opportunity. Overall, Ashgrove&#8217;s low vacancy rate, high demand, attractive rental yields, and sustainable rental growth make it a smart choice for property investors seeking long-term capital growth and rental returns.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-section elementor-inner-section elementor-element elementor-element-aeb4f30 elementor-section-boxed

Additionally, the vacancy rate is currently at a low of 1.23%, which has been trending downwards since reaching a high of 3.5% in July 2020, indicating a strong demand for rental properties in the area.</p><p>The average vendor discount percentage is under 0, which is a good sign for investors, as it indicates that properties are being sold for close to their asking price. The stock on the market percentage is also within a good range, currently at 0.9%, indicating that there is not an oversupply of properties in the area.</p><p>The demand to supply ratio is in the first percentile of markets, with a value of 71, which has been increasing recently. This suggests that demand for properties in Shailer Park is strong and likely to continue to grow, making it an attractive investment opportunity. Online search interest is also high, indicating that the suburb is gaining attention from potential buyers and renters.</p><p>In terms of financial returns, Shailer Park offers a gross yield of 5.8%, which has remained stable around the 6% mark for the past two years. Rental growth rate has seen a massive increase recently, currently sitting at 35.99%, which may attract more investors looking to capitalize on this growth.</p><p>While long-term growth rate percentage is below the median at 0.13%, it has recently started to creep up again after peaking at 2% in the third quarter of 2022. This could be a good sign of catch-up potential for investors.</p><p>Overall, the combination of high demand, low vacancy rates, stable gross yield, and recent growth in rental growth rate make Shailer Park a promising suburb for property investment.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-section elementor-inner-section elementor-element

Don’t take that risk. </em></p>\n<p>Our brokers have seen all sorts of mistakes in the past! With their level of experience, they know problems you may face on your loan application and how to mitigate them when <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/applying-for-a-mortgage/\">applying with a specific bank or lender</a>. We have a wide range of lenders on our panel and our brokers intimately understand their credit policies.</p>\n<p>We can do this through our own internal credit assessment process which we complete before applying with any lender. Our team has its own internal Credit Manager who reviews each application before being submitted to the lenders, meaning we won’t apply with a lender who won’t approve your loan.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>✅ Phone: <a href=\"tel:1300088065\">1300 088 065</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/contact/\">✅ Contact us here</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/free-assessment/\">✅ Book A Free Assessment</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Why do I need a broker if I can get a loan through my bank?</strong></h2>\n<p>We take extra time up front to go through your full situation and provide a complete lending solution.</p>\n<p>You might have a situation where your bank will approve a loan for you to buy a block of land and then not approve the construction loan when its time to construct a house on it!</p>\n<p>Our brokers will look at your needs now and into the future, to make sure you have the best possible loan that looks after all of your needs.</p>\n<h2><strong>What is a mortgage broker?</strong></h2>\n<p>A mortgage broker is a consultant that can help you with finding a home loan, or mortgage usually from their panel of lenders. Once the right home loan has been selected, the mortgage broker will help you manage the home loan process, from initially signing the paperwork all the way until settlement.</p>\n<h2><strong>What does a mortgage broker do?</strong></h2>\n<p>A mortgage broker acts on your behalf to arrange a home loan through a bank or lender. Australian banks and lenders have different policies and loan requirements, and it is a brokers job to find a loan from one of these parties that fit with your individual situation.</p>\n<p>Mortgage Brokers can help find the right home loan for any situation, from purchasing your first home to buying an investment property all the way to refinancing your mortgage to a better interest rate.</p>\n<p>At <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/\">Hunter Galloway</a> we have access to over 30 different banks and lenders, giving you a wide range of home loan options to ensure we have a lender that can fit in with what you need.</p>\n<h2><strong>How much does it cost to use a broker and your services?</strong></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/home-loans-brisbane/\">Our services</a> are completely free for all home and investment loans. We get paid by the lenders for doing the work, collating your loan application and meeting with you that otherwise would be done by a bank manager or branch lender so you get access to the same rates as if you went to the lender directly.</p>\n<p>The advantage for you is that unlike when dealing with one bank, we can help you work with a wider variety of lenders and get the best options that work for you choosing from our panel of over 30 banks and lenders!</p>\n<h2><strong>How do brokers get paid? </strong></h2>\n<p>Mortgage brokers in Brisbane get paid commissions from the banks, we do the same work the branch manager would do in putting together your loan application &#8211; except we are invested in your loan application and will work very hard to get it approved, as well as provide incredible service.</p>\n<p>As our team at <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/\">Hunter Galloway</a> are mortgage broking and credit experts we can answer all of your questions instead of directing you to another department.</p>\n<h2><strong>FBAA &amp; Credit and Investments Ombudsman Membership </strong></h2>\n<p>As members of the <a href=\"https://www.fbaa.com.au/\">Financial Brokers Association of Australia (FBAA)</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.cio.org.au\">Credit and Investments Ombudsman (CIO)</a> we must uphold the highest level of excellence when helping clients with their finances.

Banks, solicitors, valuers, different online systems, the list goes on!</p>\n<p>Before you start talking to your bank you have your mortgage broker, their aggregator and software provider &#8211; just to prepare and lodge your application!</p>\n<p>When your file reaches the bank’s system they will instruct a valuation management company, like Valex or VMS who then instruct subcontracting valuers to inspect the company, as well as obtain a copy of your credit report from the credit reporting bureau.</p>\n<p>If you have less than a 20% deposit (or are borrowing more than 80% of the properties value) then the bank will also need to get approval for your loan from the mortgage insurers &#8211; who have the final say on the application.</p>\n<p>Once your loan has been approved the banks often use solicitors to prepare the loan offer and contracts, as well a separate settlement agent to arranger cheques and fund your loan.</p>\n<p>We help cut out all the noise in the process, we deal with the banks and third parties on your behalf &#8211; and always keep you in the loop.</p>\n<h2><strong>Valuation issues &amp; credit scores </strong></h2>\n<p>One of the most common issues we see is with valuations and shortfalls which can ultimately stop your property journey before it even begins. We can order free upfront valuations with many of our lenders, meaning we can find out what your bank thinks your property is worth way before applying with them.</p>\n<p>From experience, we know that ordering a valuation prior to applying for a home loan makes sure your credit file doesn’t get damaged from having multiple enquiries.</p>\n<p>We can provide free valuations and also a copy of your credit file so you know where you stand way before applying for a loan with the banks!</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignright wp-image-7443 size-medium\" title=\"Mortgage Broker Brisbane\" src=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/mortgage-broker-brisbane-1-300x210.jpg\" alt=\"mortgage broker brisbane\" width=\"300\" height=\"210\" /></p>\n<h2><strong>Complex Credit Policy Pitfalls </strong></h2>\n<p>Each lender and bank in Australia has a unique credit policy, meaning while some will accept your full income, others may not allow it due to their policy.</p>\n<p>Quite often bank policy can be set in stone, and due to the complexity bank staff quite honestly don’t know it nor do many mortgage broker Brisbane. They are not familiar with complex situations and how to correctly assess them. This can sometimes cause it to take quite a long time to process your application and even in some instances mean your loan will get declined for no good reason.</p>\n<p>With banks making their policies more and more complex it becomes more important to correctly package, and asses your application before it is even lodged with the bank &#8211; showing the banks all of the strengths of your home loan application and making sure it fits all of their policies.</p>\n<p>At <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/\">Hunter Galloway</a> we have our own in-house credit team and we make sure your application is going to fit with the bank each time.</p>\n<h2><strong>What is an Independent Mortgage Broker?</strong></h2>\n<p>An Independent Mortgage Broker in Brisbane is someone that is not subjected to outside authority in other words, they should only be working under a fee for service model and not be paid commissions by the banks.</p>\n<p>The majority of Mortgage and Finance Brokers across Australia are not technically independent, and it is fairly uncommon in Australia to have financially independent mortgage brokers because in the past they have proven to be financially unstable due to having a longer turn around time and very limited bank options.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/\">Hunter Galloway</a> is an independently owned Mortgage Broker, we use Connective Financial services as our aggregator who provide the latest technology and training to help find our customers the best finance options. We are not owned by a bank, and operate under the belief that <em>clients come first</em>, using our team of experts we will find the best finance solution for you.</p>\n<h2><strong>Why should I use a mortgage broker in Brisbane? </strong></h2>\n<p>The best mortgage brokers can help you through their intimate knowledge of credit policy, making the home loan process quick, easy and stress-free.</p>\n<p>We work with a wide range of borrowers, from <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/first-home-buyer-loans/\">first home owners</a>, <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/property-investor-portfolio/\">experienced property investors</a> to <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/home-loans-for-doctors/\">medical professionals</a> helping them find the best deal.</p>\n<p>Through our intimate bank credit knowledge, we can find ‘secret’ policy exceptions to get approvals for applications that would normally get declined, including no deposit <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/guarantor-home-loan/\">guarantor home loans</a> and <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/unusual-employment-loan/\">unusual employment loans</a>.</p>\n<p>We also have very strong relationships with the credit teams and key staff at the banks meaning we are also in a good position to get the very best interest rates for you. Often this means a cheaper variable or fixed interest rates, or rebates from the bank to cover the costs to <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/refinance-home-loan/\">refinance your loan</a>.</p>\n<h2><strong>Why choose us?</strong></h2>\n<p>Our focus is on taking the stress out of the home loan process.</p>\n<p>We are different from a lot of traditional mortgage brokers who are one person operations.

If so, there are a number of things you have to understand before finalising any home loan package, including the type of home loan, fixed and variable nature of home loans, fees, and other features.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_8134\" style=\"width: 736px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-8134\" class=\"size-full wp-image-8134\" src=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/brisbane-property-options.jpg\" alt=\"brisbane property options\" width=\"726\" height=\"484\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-8134\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Finding the right home loan is the first step on the path to owning your own home.</em></p></div>\n\n<h2><strong>Types of Loans</strong></h2>\n<p>It’s important to understand different types of loans because when it comes to finding the <u>right home loan</u> package when buying a house, this information will help you make the right decision</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>✅ Basic Loan </strong>– This home loan type only offers a few features and has a low-interest It will not be a suitable option for those who want to make additional repayments.</li>\n<li><strong>✅ Standard Loan</strong> – This loan type offers more flexibility compared to a basic loan. With the standard home loan, you can redraw the money you have paid in and can also switch to a variable rate. In fact, it also allows you to divide the loan into the fixed and variable loan.</li>\n<li><strong>✅ Home Loan Package </strong>– This loan type is cheaper compared to a basic loan type. With this loan type, you get a free transaction account and you are not even required to have an annual fee credit card.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" alt=\"\" class=\"btn_yellow rc_open on_page\" style=\"margin: 0 auto;margin-top:20px;\">Get a Free Assessment</a></p>\n\n<h2><strong>Fixed vs Variable Loan</strong></h2>\n<p>In addition to knowing about different types of loans available in the market, you must also be aware of the nature of different loan types. This is very important, especially if you want to find the right home loan package.</p>\n<p>In a fixed rate home loan, the interest rate remains fixed throughout the terms of the loan, whereas, in a variable rate home loan, the rate changes in accordance with the change in market interest rates.</p>\n<p>With a fixed rate home loan, you can stick to your budget without worrying about incorporating the rate fluctuation, but in times of low interest rates, you would be stuck with paying a high-interest repayment. Therefore, when you plan to choose the right home loan, make sure that you keep this in mind as it will allow you to make the right decision for your financial goals.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_8539\" style=\"width: 737px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-8539\" class=\"size-full wp-image-8539\" src=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/fixed-vs-variable-home-loans-for-contract-income-1.png\" alt=\"fixed vs variable home loans for contract income\" width=\"727\" height=\"524\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-8539\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Fixed and variable rates both have their advantages and disadvantages.</em></p></div>\n\n<h2><strong>Fees Involved</strong></h2>\n<p>Interest repayments are not the only cost you have to bear when applying for a home loan, there are other fees involved as well, such as establishment fees, valuation cost, inspection cost, and more. Do not hesitate to ask the lender about all the fees included in a home loan. Asking the right questions will eventually lead to the right home loan package.</p>\n<p>Let’s take a look at some of the fees involved:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>✅ Break cost </strong>– When it comes to loans at a fixed rate, they can have high exit fees, especially if the variable rate is lower. If you want to get out of this home loan, you are required to make up for all the lost interest that could be earned by the bank if you had paid higher interest rates till the end of the term. This is known as the break cost.</li>\n<li><strong>✅ Annual or Monthly Fee</strong> – This is an ongoing fee, and is paid on a regular basis. However, the monthly and annual fees also are a contributing factor in deciding how soon will you be able to pay back the loan.</li>\n<li><strong>✅ Lender’s Mortgage Insurance (LMI) </strong>– This cost is charged by the lender to ensure themselves should the borrower default on a loan. It is normally charged if you have less than 20 per cent of a deposit.</li>\n<li><strong>✅ Valuation fees </strong>– This is a fee charged by a lender for the property valuation. You may have to bear this cost even if the loan does not get approved. Inquire whether you meet the requirements for the loan before submitting an application.</li>\n<li><strong>✅ Application fees </strong>– Lenders can also ask for an upfront application fee and an establishment fee. You can talk to your bank and seek a discount or ask them to waive it altogether.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Being aware of these charges is very important for you to be able to find the right home loan. It will help you prepare yourself beforehand to be able to meet all the financial responsibilities that come with finding the right home loan in Brisbane.</p>\n\r<p class=\"testm_header\">Hunter Galloway Mortgage Brokers have helped <strong>hundreds of home owners.</strong></p>\r<p class=\"testm_top\">communication was superb and the whole process was hassle free…</p>\n<p class=\"testm_text\">We have dealt through Mortgage Choice and also directly with CUA and your service was better than our previous experiences.

Through this, if you are a first home buyer, you can get up to $23,750 of benefits when you purchase or build a new house in Queensland. The following is a break down of the total amount:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>$15,000 of the total amount represents building grant</li>\n<li>$8,750 is the stamp duty rebate if you purchase a property with a price of $500,000 or less than $550,000</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can be either be eligible for one of these incentives or both.</p>\n\n<h2>Queensland&#8217;s First Home Owners Grant</h2>\n<p>As discussed, it is a one-off payment by the government to facilitate the first time home buyer. The value of the grant was worth $20,000 until 30<sup>th</sup> June 2017. From then, it will revert back to its original value, i.e., $15,000 after that date. The purpose of this short-term increase in the value of the grant was to encourage new buyers into buying a new home quickly.</p>\n<p>You may not be able to avail the grant if you are purchasing an already built house, but you can be eligible for a stamp duty rebate. You can get a rebate if you fulfil the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You have not previously owned a residential property</li>\n<li>You plan to live in a house for a period of at least 12 months</li>\n<li>Your minimum age should be 18 years and you must be a permanent resident of Australia</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Qualification Criteria for QLD First Home Buyer Grant</strong></h3>\n<p>In order to qualify for the grant, you need to do the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Buy Land</strong> – In case you plan to build a home, you should buy land before you sign a contract for building your house. Although it is not a mandatory requirement for winning a grant, it will allow you to build a house in accordance with the piece of land.</li>\n<li><strong>Property Type</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>You are building your own house</li>\n<li>Purchasing a brand new home</li>\n<li>Buying off a plan</li>\n<li>Buying a property that will undergo heavy renovation</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Maximum Purchase Price</strong> – The overall property price should be below $750,000. For example, you buy a piece of land for $350,000 and spend another $350,000 on the construction of a house, with $45,000 on solar panels, fencing, or landscaping. Therefore, the total value of a property will be $745,000.</li>\n<li><strong>No Previous Grant Received</strong> – Lastly, you have not received a grant in any territory or state of Australia before.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is important to note that you will only be eligible for $20,000 grant only if you have signed a contract by 30<sup>th</sup> June 2017. For any contract after that date, you are eligible to receive a grant worth $15,000.</p>\n<h3><strong>Can a First Home Buyer Grant be Used as Deposit?</strong></h3>\n<p>The answer is yes! You can use the grant as a deposit. This facility allows you to purchase or construct your house sooner. There are a number of people who borrow construction loans for this purpose because they do not have enough savings to purchase a piece of land or pay for construction. Therefore, you must consult a mortgage broker whenever you plan to buy a house as he or she can guide you in the right direction.</p>\n<p>You can use the grant as a deposit to get the loan. In addition to that, you must also look at the timing for when you will receive a grant and when you should pay the deposit. The broker can help you sort the matter out efficiently without experiencing any delay.</p>\n<h3><strong>How to Apply for QLD First Home Buyer Grant?</strong></h3>\n<p>Building societies, financial institutions, and banks are the approved agents of the Queensland Office of State Revenue. Speak to our team of mortgage brokers directly who will put you in contact with the best lender for you. After they are contacted, the grant can be arranged for you.</p>\n<p>You can also take an alternate route by downloading an application form. Fill in the form and submit it directly to the office once the construction is complete and you will receive a building certificate for a new house.</p>\n<p>All in all, before you plan to buy a house or apply for the grant, it is best to seek the guidance of your mortgage broker as he or she can give you reasonable advice based on their years of experience in the real estate market.</p>\n<p>Chat to Hunter Galloway today on 1300 088 065 or email Nathan at Nathan.Vecchio@HunterGalloway.com.au<br />\n</p>"

You want someone who will give you expert advice and make the home loan application process simple and stress-free.</p>\n<p>In this expert-written guide you’ll learn everything you need to know about finding the best mortgage broker for you. </p>\n<p>Let’s dive right in. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Don’t have time to read the whole guide right now?</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nNo worries. Let me send you a copy so you can read it when it’s convenient for you. Just let me know where to send it (takes 5 seconds):</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>What does a Mortgage Broker do?</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>A mortgage broker is a type of financial adviser who will help you to find the right home loan.</p>\n<p>They will compare home loans across multiple home loan providers (banks and other lenders) and find you a loan that is a best fit for your needs and financial situation.</p>\n<p>Once you have found the right loan, a good broker will be there to guide you through every step of the process and get your loan approved as quickly as possible.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Are all Mortgage Brokers the same?</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>To be blunt &#8211; no, not all mortgage brokers are the same.</p>\n<p>As with any profession, the quality of service you will get from mortgage brokers can vary widely.</p>\n<p>There are a lot of great brokers out there providing a high quality service for their customers.</p>\n<p>But unfortunately, there are also some bad brokers out there. Some mortgage brokers don’t really have your best interests at heart.</p>\n<p>It can be hard to tell the difference between a good broker and a bad broker at first glance. The process of getting a home loan is complicated and has a lot of moving parts. If you’re not a finance expert, it’s easy for a bad broker to pull the wool over your eyes.</p>\n<p>And there’s a lot at stake &#8211; for many Australians, purchasing a home is the single largest financial decision they will ever make. If you end up working with the wrong broker, it could end up costing you tens of thousands of dollars over the lifetime of your home loan.</p>\n<p>It can also mean the difference between getting the home of your dreams and missing out completely.</p>\n<p><strong>Why is that?</strong></p>\n<p>These days, banks are much stricter with their lending criteria than they used to be. It has never been harder to get finance approved than it is now.</p>\n<p>The “fast and loose” days of finance are well and truly behind us.</p>\n<p>When you apply for a home loan in today’s lending environment, the banks will go through every single piece of documentation with a fine toothed comb.</p>\n<p>They will check your live credit scoring, which means they’ll know if you’ve paid your bills (credit card, personal loan, home loan, etc.) on time over the past two years.</p>\n<p>And they will go through your bank statements line by line, questioning everything. Even the smallest inconsistency could raise a red flag which would cause your application to be declined.</p>\n<p>We have even seen cases where the banks will stalk you on Facebook to check on your relationship status!</p>\n<p>The banks are so strict at the moment that we’re seeing an average rejection rate for home loans in Australia of 40%.</p>\n<p>Now, more than ever, it’s critical to find a broker who will go the extra mile and give you the best chance possible to get your loan approved so you can buy the property that you’ve been dreaming of.</p>\n<p>Finding the right broker makes all the difference. While the average brokers are seeing a rejection rate of 40%, a good broker will give you a much better chance of getting your loan approved.</p>\n<p>Here at Hunter Galloway, our average rejection rate is less than 3%.</p>\n<p><strong>So how do you find a good mortgage broker?</strong></p>\n<p>There’s only one way to sort out the superstars from the sellouts – and that’s to do some due diligence on your broker so you can make sure you’re making the right choice.</p>\n<p>As a director at Hunter Galloway, Brisbane’s Highest-Rated Mortgage Broker, I’m confident that we are the best broker for you. </p>\n<p>But you don’t need to take my word for it.  In this guide you’ll learn everything you need to know about finding the best mortgage broker for you. </p>\n<p>I invite you to use these tips to evaluate our service and compare it with any other broker you’d like.

A broker’s role is to essentially be a conduit between you and the banks. Rather than telling you what to do, they’ll actively do the leg work for you.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It starts with spending some time with you to understand your needs and requirements. From there, they will work out exactly how much you can afford to borrow across a number of different lenders.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">If they come across any issues that could prevent you from being approved for a loan, they will work with you to resolve those issues, or find you a lender who is willing to work with you.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">They will find you a number of different home loan options and explain how each loan option works, including the costs associated with them.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">If you decide to go ahead with a loan application, they will help you to apply for the home loan and manage the process all the way from pre-approval to settlement.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">If you’re not ready to buy a home right now, a good broker won’t leave you high and dry &#8211; they will provide you with the tools and educational material you need to help you get ready.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Once your home loan is settled, they will perform regular checks to make sure you are getting the best available rate. If you’re not on the best rate, they will help you to refinance your home loan when the time is right.</p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><b>What does a bad broker do?</b></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">A bad broker doesn’t really care about you. To them, you are just a number. They will do the minimum amount of work possible to get as much money out of your home loan as they can.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">A bad broker will not take the time to understand your unique situation. They will pretend to listen to your needs, but they won’t have your best interests at heart when they make their recommendations.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">They might push you into getting a loan that is too big &#8211; great for them, because they get a higher commission, but bad for you because you can end up with a loan that you can’t afford.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">They might submit your loan application without taking the time to ensure that you have a high chance of getting approved.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Instead of offering you a loan that is suited to your goals and priorities, they will railroad you into getting a loan that offers them the biggest commission.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To be fair, not all brokers are so sinister. Some brokers are bad not because they are focused only on the money, but because they are inexperienced or disorganised.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">But these brokers are just as bad &#8211; if your broker is inexperienced, they might not be able to find a suitable loan for you, simply because they don’t understand the policies of all of the different lenders.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And if they are disorganised,<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>your loan could be declined because they missed some important information in your application, or they missed an important deadline.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Whatever the reason, you want to avoid working with a bad broker at all costs.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In the rest of this guide, we’ll dive into the details of how to sort the good brokers from the bad.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Research the Broker’s Online Reviews in Brisbane</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The first thing you should do when looking for a <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/mortgage-broker-brisbane/\">Mortgage Broker</a>  is jump online and check their online reviews. Reading past reviews from their customers should give you an idea on their level of customer service and competence which should help you find the best <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/mortgage-broker-brisbane/\">mortgage broker in Brisbane</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">We recommend looking at reviews on the following sites:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.google.com.au/search?q=hunter+galloway&amp;oq=hunter+galloway&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60j69i61j69i60l3.1294j0j1&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8#lrd=0x6b91581f483d77a3:0xfddf27dad5e4a55f,1,,,\">☑️ Google Reviews</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/MortgageBrokerBrisbane/\">☑️ Facebook Reviews</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.productreview.com.au/p/hunter-galloway.html\">☑️ Product Review</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">If your broker has a 5-star average rating, that&#8217;s a great sign. But it&#8217;s important to dig a little deeper.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Take a few minutes to read some of the reviews. Make sure that the reviews look real. Some brokers might use fake reviews to artificially inflate their ratings. But usually it’s pretty obvious which ones are fake and which ones are real. </p>\n<p class=\"p1\">If there are any “middle of the road” reviews (2,3, or 4 stars) take special note of these. They can give you an indication of how the broker handles customers when things don’t go smoothly.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">1 star reviews are also worth looking at, but we recommend taking these with a grain of salt. 1 star reviews are often left by disgruntled customers and may not accurately reflect the business. </p>\n<p><strong>At Hunter Galloway, we are proud to have over 300+ Google Reviews, and 30+ Facebook reviews from our happy customers!

Here are the credentials you should check:</p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><strong>Are they registered with ASIC?</strong></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/mortgage-broker-brisbane/\">Mortgage Broker&#8217;s in Brisbane</a> are required to have a Credit License, or be a Credit Representative to operate.</p>\n<p>You can see if they are members on the <a href=\"https://connectonline.asic.gov.au/RegistrySearch/faces/landing/ProfessionalRegisters.jspx?_adf.ctrl-state=tar7xtr4a_4\">ASIC Register</a> portal.

This make sure the brokers keep up to date on the latest policies and compliance procedures.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">If your broker isn’t a member of the MFAA or FBAA it should be considered a red flag as they could have been made to leave the industry due to issues in the past.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">If you can’t find them on their membership lists, make sure to ask them if they are registered with the MFAA or FBAA when you speak to them.</p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><b>Are they part of an ASIC-approved external dispute resolution scheme? </b></h3>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.04688rem; letter-spacing: -0.01em;\">Mortgage Brokers in Brisbane need to be a member of the <a href=\"https://www.cio.org.au/\">Credit &amp; Investments Ombudsman (CIO)</a> or the <a href=\"http://www.fos.org.au/\">Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS)</a>.

Each loan product has different interest rates, features, and fees.

If not, be careful because they might be more interested in their wallets than your financial health.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Here are some things to think about:</p>\n<h3><b>What are you looking at doing? </b></h3>\n<p>Are you buying a home?<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Building a home?

Or do you want to pay down your mortgage as quickly as you can? Are you planning on living in this property for several years, or are you looking to turn it into an investment or upgrade to a new property within a couple of years?</p>\n<p>Having a clear idea on this, and explaining your needs to your mortgage broker can make sure you get the best results.</p>\n<p><strong>Read More: <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/first-home-buyer-guide/\">First Home Buyer Information</a></strong></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Ask Them Why You Should Choose Them Over a Bank</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Once you’ve explained your needs to your<a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/mortgage-broker-brisbane/\"> mortgage broker</a>, ask them this question: “Why should I choose you over a bank?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Their answer will tell you a lot about how they perceive themselves, what areas they specialise in, and what value they add to the home loan process.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Here are some of the reasons why we recommend using Hunter Galloway over a bank:</p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li1\"><span>✅  </span>We can find you the best loan options across a panel of over 30 lenders &#8211; banks can only offer you a limited number of options based on their own products.</li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span>✅  </span>We are always on top of the latest developments in the mortgage market and what different policies are available for you to take advantage of (for example <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/no-lmi-and-90-lvr/\">90% no LMI loans for pharmacists</a> or <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/home-loans-for-doctors/\">medical professionals</a>).</li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span>✅  </span>Our internal credit team will thoroughly analyse your application to make sure we resolve any issues <i>before</i> the bank sees your loan application, giving you the best chance of a successful application.</li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span>✅  </span>If you are looking to refinance, we are able to negotiate significant discounts with your existing bank because the bank knows we can find you a loan somewhere else.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/free-assessment/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8405\" src=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/chat-to-mortgage-expert.png\" alt=\"chat-to-mortgage-expert\" width=\"241\" height=\"48\" /></a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/free-assessment/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-8386 size-full\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/first-homebuyer-brisbane.png\" alt=\"first-homebuyer-brisbane\" width=\"600\" height=\"503\" /></a> <em>Looking at Reviews &amp; Testimonials from your mortgage brokers existing clients can help understand who, and how they help. </em></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Determine Their Experience</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In finance experience counts for everything.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">If you’re working with an inexperienced broker, they might tell you that you don’t qualify for a loan because they don’t have a thorough knowledge of the lending policies of the banks.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Or they might find you an inferior home loan.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">An experienced broker will know the lending policies of the banks inside and out.

We have a team of home loan experts.</em></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Ask Them Their Net Promoter Score (NPS)</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The net promoter score is a metric used across many industries to measure the overall happiness of customers. </p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Any broker who is dedicated to delivering the best possible customer service will track their NPS so they can make sure they are doing everything they can to keep their customers happy. </p>\n<p class=\"p1\">When you’re talking to your broker, ask them about their NPS score. Specifically, ask them these questions:</p>\n<ol class=\"ol1\">\n<li class=\"li1\">Do you track your net promoter score? If so, how do you track it, with what software?</li>\n<li class=\"li1\">What is your current net promoter score?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p class=\"p1\">The higher the NPS score, the more satisfied their customers are.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">On average, brokers have a Net Promoter Score in excess of 70.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Here at Hunter Galloway, our NPS score is 88.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To contrast this, major banks will often report a negative NPS, with the highest scoring in the low 50s.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Request Their Lender Panel</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">There are over 50 banks and other lenders who offer home loan products in Australia, but brokers can’t offer home loans from every lender. They are restricted by the list of banks they can access. This list is known as the “lender panel”.</p>\n\n<p>The majority of accredited <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/mortgage-broker-brisbane/\">mortgage brokers</a> have at least 20 different lenders and bankers they can utilise to help give you the best home loan but some have as few as 9 banks on their panel.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">If a broker has one a small number of banks on their panel, it can be a red flag that suggests they are focusing on a small number of lenders which could limit your options (and your ability to get a home loan).</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It’s important to know which lenders are on your broker’s panel and which aren’t — and importantly, why?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In some cases, a broker might not have access to a lender due to volume requirements, where a broker doesn’t do enough business. For example the<a href=\"https://www.commbank.com.au/\">Commonwealth Bank (CBA)</a> requires <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/mortgage-broker-brisbane/\">brokers</a> to submit a minimum amount of home loan applications per year to maintain their accreditations.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-7451\" src=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/mortgage-broker-brisbane-1-300x257.jpg\" alt=\"mortgage broker brisbane\" width=\"300\" height=\"257\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" /></p>\n<p><em>Having a large range of lenders ultimately gives you more options and more choice! At Hunter Galloway, we have over 30 Lenders to choose from! </em></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Ask About Their Home Loan Research Process</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">A large part of the broker’s job is to research which loans are suitable for you across the hundreds of loan products offered by the different banks and lenders.</p>\n<p>Ask your <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/mortgage-broker-brisbane/\">broker</a> how they will decide which loan will best suit your needs. </p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Do they have a robust process they use to search across all of the different loans? Or is their home loan research less organised, more off-the-cuff?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">If they are saying they will just find you the lowest rate possible across the different banks, you will need to ask more questions.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Everyone wants the lowest interest rate possible, but what you’re really looking for is the lowest interest rate possible <i>that also satisfies your other needs and requirements. </i>A low-interest rate loan might seem cheaper up front, but you might end up spending more in the long run if the loan isn’t suitable for your unique financial goals.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">For example, at the moment the lowest interest rates available are from fixed-rate loans. But if you’re looking to make extra repayments or you might end up selling the property within the fixed-rate period, you could attract additional fees which can add up to a significant sum.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In addition to this it’s good knowing their process and what goes on in the background to get your loan approved – do they have other team members or support staff? Do they outsource their loan processing to an offshore company, or do they do all of their own work in house?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">If they are a one-person brokerage, what happens if they get sick, or take holidays – will your loan still get processed? It’s always good to know they have a team working in the background to make sure you not only get the best deal, but you are also looked after in the process.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Here at Hunter Galloway, our four brokers are supported by a team of two Mortgage Experts and six Credit Analysts, all working out of our office.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/free-assessment/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-7962\" src=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Mortgage-Home-Loan-Application.jpg\" alt=\"Mortgage Home Loan Application\" width=\"401\" height=\"266\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Find out your mortgage brokers research process.

Just like cars and coffee machines, home loans are also filled to the brim with features and optional add-ons.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">But these features come at a cost. If you’re not going to use those features, then you’ll be wasting money.</p>\n<p>Speak to your broker about features like <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/home-loan-extra-repayment-calculator/\">extra repayments</a>, redraw facility and <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/offset-account/\">offset accounts</a>. And if you&#8217;re unsure about what any of these are, find out what they mean for you and which ones will help you.</p>\n<p>Each situation is unique, and this will impact which features are best for you.</p>\n<p>And, if you&#8217;re preparing for changes like a new baby on the way, going on <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/maternity-leave-home-loan/\">maternity leave</a> or renovations, you&#8217;ll need to keep this in mind as it will be able to help you figure out which features are most important and relevant to you.</p>\n<p><strong>Read More: <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/home-loan-extra-repayment-calculator/\">Extra Home Loan Repayment Calculator</a></strong></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Question their Turn Around Time</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>You also want to ask your <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/mortgage-broker-brisbane/\">broker</a> how fast they can turn around your mortgage application.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Your broker’s ability to get a quick turn around could make or break your first home purchase.</p>\n<p>Like we mentioned in the last point, many <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/mortgage-broker-brisbane/\">Mortgage Brokers</a> in Australia are one man bands, in other words they do not have any additional staff and if they are sick or away your home loan application can sit on your brokers desk not progressing.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Other brokers utilise an offshore company to aid their loan processing. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but it can introduce some delays in your turn around time.</p>\n<p>Equally if you have <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/signed-a-contract-of-sale/\">Signed a Contract</a> of sale subject to 14 days finance, you don&#8217;t want to risk losing the property if the broker can&#8217;t get your loan approved in time.</p>\n<p><strong>You also want to ask the broker what the bank you are applying with&#8217;s turn around time is, because some banks are known to be notoriously slow with processing loan applications. </strong></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-11378 aligncenter size-full\" src=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/mortgage-broker-turn-around-time-1.png\" alt=\"mortgage broker turn around time\" width=\"498\" height=\"410\" /></p>\n<p>In fact, we&#8217;ve heard stories of banks taking 12 business days &#8211; In other words, almost 3 weeks &#8211; to get a loan approval 😳. This is not workable for most purchases.</p>\n<p>At Hunter Galloway, our <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/mortgage-broker-brisbane/\">Mortgage Brokers</a> will be upfront with you and give expected turn around times at all stages of the <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/home-loan-process/\">home loan process</a> and we will return all phone calls within 4 business hours.</p>\n<p>We have very good contacts with the State Managers and Senior Management at most banks and can get things turned around much quicker than the average broker &#8211; infact our average home loan application is formally approved in under a week.</p>\n<p>If it is going to take your broker more than a few days to get your home loan approved, then <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/free-assessment/\">speak with our team</a> to see how we can help you out much faster than regular mortgage brokers.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Ask Their Mortgage Application Approval (And Rejection) Rates</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>While <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/mortgage-broker-brisbane/\">broker&#8217;s</a> can help you negotiate interest rates, an even more important function is actually getting your loan approved in the first place!</p>\n<p>This is because getting a home loan has gotten much more difficult in 2019 in light of the Royal Commission and Banks tightening their credit criteria.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_11386\" style=\"width: 832px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-11386\" class=\"wp-image-11386 size-full\" src=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/home-loan-rejection.png\" alt=\"home loan rejection\" width=\"822\" height=\"310\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-11386\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">According to research completed earlier in the year, the home loan rejection rate hit over 40%.</p></div>\n\n<p>In other words, earlier this year 4 in 10 home loan applications were being knocked back or <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/loan-declined-after-pre-approval/\">declined</a>.</p>\n<p>Ask your <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/mortgage-broker-brisbane/\">Mortgage Broker</a> what their approval rates are, and on average how many applications they have had <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/loan-declined-after-pre-approval/\">declined</a> in the past 12 months.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">We take the time up front to understand your situation, what you are looking to achieve and then find a bank that fits with you.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Before your application gets to the bank, our internal Credit Team thoroughly reviews every application to make sure that there aren’t any issues that could cause your home loan to be rejected.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Thanks to this approach we have helped over 639 home owners in buying a house in the past 12 months, and our Mortgage Application Approval rate is over 97.5%.</strong></p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t risk having your home loan declined, <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/free-assessment/\">get in touch with our team today</a> to see how we can help get your Home Loan Approved.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Ask About  Commissions</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In general, mortgage<a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/mortgage-broker-brisbane/\">brokers</a> get paid a commission from the bank that gives you your loan. That’s how we are able to offer our services free of charge to you.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In some cases, mortgage brokers will charge you a fee for their services. This typically happens with commercial loans or development finance, but it’s always best to know up front what you’re getting into so there aren’t any surprise fees later down the track.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">When you get a home loan with us, we will tell you exactly how much commission we will be earning from your bank.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The commissions paid by banks do vary slightly between banks, which could be a potential conflict of interest. Rest assured that we put your own best interests before our own &#8211; it’s far more important to us that you get the best possible home loan than to earn a slightly higher commission.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Make sure that your broker is open and transparent about their fee structure. If you’re concerned they might be offering you a home loan solely based on the commission they can earn, ask them to explain why this particular loan is best for you.</p>\n<p><strong>At <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/contact/\">Hunter Galloway</a>, we do not charge any additional fees for our service. </strong></p>\n<p>We are paid commissions by the banks so our services do not cost anything to you.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Check Their Ownership Structure</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Ask your broker who owns them. Are they independently owned? Or are they owned or part-owned by one of the big banks?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Brokers who are not independent may have a significant conflict of interest &#8211; they are incentivised to sell you loans that flow straight back to the bank that owns them.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This might not be obvious at first glance &#8211; some brokers will offer “white-label loans”. These loans are branded with a different name, hiding the fact that they are actually a loan from one of the big banks.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">That’s why it’s important to ask up front. You want to make sure that your broker is offering you a loan based on what’s best for you, not what’s best for lining the coffers of their parent company.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\" >Ask About Home Loan Rebates</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>From time to time there are home loan rebates and specials available from mortgage lenders including cashback deals.</p>\n<p>Lenders can offer up to $2,000 in cash back rebates and rewards after a loan has been refinanced.</p>\n<p>Talk to a<a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/free-assessment/\"> mortgage expert</a> and see if you qualify for cash back rewards and rebates.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Check Their Communication Skills</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">After speaking with your broker, assess their communication skills. A good broker should be able to explain the complicated loan terms and processes in simple, easy to understand language.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">They should be able to present you with a number of different loan options and clearly explain their reasons for recommending specific loans.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">A good broker will also have good listening skills. If they start bombarding you with your loan options before you’ve even had a chance to explain your goals and priorities, this is a big red flag.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">If your broker isn’t listening to you, there’s a good chance they are more focused on the commission you represent than getting you the best outcome. You might end up with the wrong loan.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Finally, take note if you feel pressured by the broker at any stage during the process of getting a home loan. As mentioned earlier, a good broker is a conduit between you and the banks &#8211; they will do the leg work to find your loan options for you and give you guidance, but they will not pressure you into choosing a specific loan. Brokers are not dictators.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Make Sure They Are Organised</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">There are a lot of moving parts in the home loan application process. As your application progresses, it will change hands multiple times. There are often follow-up requests from the banks that need to be managed, and extra documentation that needs to be supplied. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">On top of this, brokers are dealing with multiple clients and applications on a daily basis. With so many balls in the air at once, if your broker isn’t organised there is a good chance they might make a mistake somewhere along the line. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If they drop the ball on your home loan application, you might miss out on your property purchase entirely. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As you interact with your broker, take note of their behaviour and the way they handle your loan application. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Are they regularly late to meetings? Do they return your calls? More importantly, is your broker proactively contacting you to keep you in the loop as your application progresses?</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Do they seems to have a well structured process in place, or are the “shooting from the hip”?</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A good broker will have systems and processes to make sure that nothing is missed, and that you are kept informed. </span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Don’t Make Too Many Applications</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It’s perfectly fine to talk to multiple brokers to find someone that is a good fit for you before applying for a loan. But you should never submit multiple loan applications with multiple lenders.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Making too many home loan applications can affect your <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/how-did-i-get-a-bad-credit-score/\">credit rating</a>. This can cause your loan to be declined.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This goes for pre-approvals as well &#8211; too many pre-approvals in a short time can also put a dent in your credit score.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Be wary if your broker is pushing you into a pre-approval too quickly. Some brokers will use a pre-approval as a way to lock you in as a client &#8211; it’s much harder to switch if you’ve already got a pre-approval.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Here at Hunter Galloway, we will only recommend a pre-approval when you’re at the stage where you’re ready to buy within the next three months.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">That keeps your options open if a better deal comes along and reduces the risk of affecting your credit score.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">If you want a pre-approval in order to know your borrowing capacity, we have a better option for you.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">We have developed an in-house “Home Buying Potential” report that gives you all of the information you need to feel comfortable moving forward with a home purchase <i>without</i> needing to go through the pre-approval process.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This internal assessment process is more detailed than many lenders’ pre-approval processes. It’s faster, takes less effort, and still gives you the confidence to get out there and start your home buying journey.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Get All Details In Writing</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Always ask for written recommendations and get information on commissions, fees and products in writing.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">A broker is legally obliged to follow responsible lending laws and shouldn’t sell you an inappropriate or risky loan. They are required to document your financial situation along with your financial needs and priorities.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Make sure your broker provides you a copy of their credit assessment and double check that what your broker told you matches up with what’s on paper.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.moneysmart.gov.au/borrowing-and-credit/home-loans/using-a-broker\">ASIC recommends</a>, a written agreement should tell you the type of loan being arranged for you, the amount of the loan, the term of the loan, the current <a title=\"Interest rates\" href=\"https://www.moneysmart.gov.au/borrowing-and-credit/home-loans/interest-rates\">interest rate</a>, and any <a title=\"Fees\" href=\"https://www.moneysmart.gov.au/borrowing-and-credit/home-loans/fees\">fees</a> you have to pay. The fees could include broker&#8217;s fees or commissions, fees to the credit provider or lender for setting up the loan, and/or any <a class=\"glossary-link\" title=\"A fee which may be applied if a loan is repaid earlier than the stated term.\" href=\"https://www.moneysmart.gov.au/glossary/e/early-termination-fee\">early termination fees</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Your mortgage broker should always provide credit advice in writing.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Slow Down And Don’t Rush</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">If you’re trying to get a home loan on a tight deadline, you may be tempted to get your home loan sorted out ASAP and rush through the process.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">But even if you’ve got a deadline breathing down your neck, it’s important to take the time to fully understand what you’re getting into and make sure you’re comfortable with what you’re signing.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">You should never sign a blank form or leave details for the broker to fill in later.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Don’t sign anything unless you fully understand what it is. If you aren’t sure about what you are signing get independent legal advice.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And don’t let a broker pressure you into signing too quickly. Remember that the broker is supposed to help you through the home loan process, not force you through it.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">If you’re feeling pressured by your broker, ask for more time to think about the loan.

Once the right home loan has been selected, the mortgage broker will help you manage the home loan process, from initially signing the paperwork all the way until settlement.</p>\n<h2><strong>What does a mortgage broker do?</strong></h2>\n<p>A mortgage broker acts on your behalf to arrange a home loan through a bank or lender. Australian banks and lenders have different policies and loan requirements, and it is a brokers job to find a loan from one of these parties that fit with your individual situation.</p>\n<p>Mortgage Brokers can help find the right home loan for any situation, from purchasing your first home to buying an investment property all the way to refinancing your mortgage to a better interest rate.</p>\n<p>At <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/\">Hunter Galloway</a> we have access to over 30 different banks and lenders, giving you a wide range of home loan options to ensure we have a lender that can fit in with what you need.</p>\n<h2><strong>How much does it cost to&nbsp;use a broker and your services?</strong></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/home-loans-brisbane/\">Our services</a> are completely free for all home and investment loans. We get paid by the lenders for doing the work, collating your loan application and meeting with you that otherwise would be done by a bank manager or branch lender so you get access to the same rates as if you went to the lender directly.</p>\n<p>The advantage for you is that unlike when dealing with one bank, we can help you work with a wider variety of lenders and get the best options that work for you choosing from our panel of over 30 banks and lenders!</p>\n<h2><strong>How do brokers get paid?&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n<p>Mortgage brokers in Brisbane get paid commissions from the banks, we do the same work the branch manager would do in putting together your loan application &#8211; except we are invested in your loan application and will work very hard to get it approved, as well as provide incredible service.</p>\n<p>As our team at <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/\">Hunter Galloway</a> are mortgage broking and credit experts we can answer all of your questions instead of directing you to another department.</p>\n<h2><strong>FBAA &amp; Credit and Investments Ombudsman Membership&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n<p>As members of the <a href=\"https://www.fbaa.com.au/\">Financial Brokers Association of Australia (FBAA)</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.cio.org.au\">Credit and Investments Ombudsman (CIO)</a> we must uphold the highest level of excellence when helping clients with their finances.

Banks, solicitors, valuers, different online systems, the list goes on!</p>\n<p>Before you start talking to your bank you have your mortgage broker, their aggregator and software provider &#8211; just to prepare and lodge your application!</p>\n<p>When your file reaches the bank’s system they will instruct a valuation management company, like Valex or VMS who then instruct subcontracting valuers to inspect the company, as well as obtain a copy of your credit report from the credit reporting bureau.</p>\n<p>If you have less than a 20% deposit (or are borrowing more than 80% of the properties value) then the bank will also need to get approval for your loan from the mortgage insurers &#8211; who have the final say on the application.</p>\n<p>Once your loan has been approved the banks often use solicitors to prepare the loan offer and contracts, as well a separate settlement agent to arranger cheques and fund your loan.</p>\n<p>We help cut out all the noise in the process, we deal with the banks and third parties on your behalf &#8211; and always keep you in the loop.</p>\n<h2><strong>Valuation issues &amp; credit scores&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n<p>One of the most common issues we see is with valuations and shortfalls which can ultimately stop your property journey before it even begins. We can order free upfront valuations with many of our lenders, meaning we can find out what your bank thinks your property is worth way before applying with them.</p>\n<p>From experience, we know that ordering a valuation prior to applying for a home loan makes sure your credit file doesn’t get damaged from having multiple enquiries.</p>\n<p>We can provide free valuations and also a copy of your credit file so you know where you stand way before applying for a loan with the banks!</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignright wp-image-7443 size-medium\" title=\"Mortgage Broker Brisbane\" src=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/mortgage-broker-brisbane-1-300x210.jpg\" alt=\"mortgage broker brisbane\" width=\"300\" height=\"210\"></p>\n<h2><strong>Complex Credit Policy Pitfalls&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n<p>Each lender and bank in Australia has a unique credit policy, meaning while some will accept your full income, others may not allow it due to their policy.</p>\n<p>Quite often bank policy can be set in stone, and due to the complexity bank staff quite honestly don’t know it nor do many mortgage broker Brisbane. They are not familiar with complex situations and how to correctly assess them. This can sometimes cause it to take quite a long time to process your application and even in some instances mean your loan will get declined for no good reason.</p>\n<p>With banks making their policies more and more complex it becomes more important to correctly package, and asses your application before it is even lodged with the bank &#8211; showing the banks all of the strengths of your home loan application and making sure it fits all of their policies.</p>\n<p>At <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/\">Hunter Galloway</a> we have our own in-house credit team and we make sure your application is going to fit with the bank each time.</p>\n<h2><strong>What is an Independent Mortgage Broker?</strong></h2>\n<p>An Independent Mortgage Broker in Brisbane is someone that is not subjected to outside authority in other words, they should only be working under a fee for service model and not be paid commissions by the banks.</p>\n<p>The majority of Mortgage and Finance Brokers across Australia are not technically independent, and it is fairly uncommon in Australia to have financially independent mortgage brokers because in the past they have proven to be financially unstable due to having a longer turn around time and very limited bank options.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/\">Hunter Galloway</a> is an independently owned Mortgage Broker, we use Connective Financial services as our aggregator who provide the latest technology and training to help find our customers the best finance options.

But there are still a few hurdles to jump through, and you don’t want to stumble right at the finish line. The main items you need to cover are the contract of sale, the formal loan approval, and the settlement itself.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10144\" src=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/finalise-settlement-1-1024x768.png\" alt=\"finalise settlement \" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">If it’s your first time buying a home, you might have some trepidation about the contract—you don’t want to miss a critical clause in the contract that bites you in the backside. And by this stage your loan has been pre-approved, but there’s still the risk of being declined at the formal approval.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This part of the process is actually pretty straightforward. In this chapter you will learn how everything works from the contract of sale right through to settlement. Powered by this knowledge, you’ll be in control of the process at every step of the way.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-9629\" src=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/new-farm-property.jpg\" alt=\"new farm property\" width=\"800\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">You’re almost there!

Not having home insurance is very risky, as it covers you for any loss or damage to the building.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Your bank or lender will want proof the property has insurance on it, so it’s best to get it right away because you are going to need it eventually. </span><span class=\"s2\">Sometimes lenders want their borrowers to get building insurance before proceeding with the settlement. In fact, they want it to be included in the policy.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_8082\" style=\"width: 687px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-8082\" class=\"size-full wp-image-8082\" src=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/home-insurance-quote.png\" alt=\"home-insurance-quote\" width=\"677\" height=\"793\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-8082\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Getting a home insurance quote is as easy as going online.</p></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s2\"><b>Why Do You Need Building Insurance?</b></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">There is often confusion about who is responsible for the property insurance for the period from signing the contract until settlement.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">According to FindLaw:</p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s2\">In Queensland, contrary to the practice adopted in some other states and sometimes assumed by parties to the property transaction, the standard terms of contract usually provide for the risk in a property to pass from the seller to the buyer, not from the settlement date, but from 5 p.m. on the first business day after the date that the seller signs the contract.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s2\">So you need to make sure you have insurance from 5 p.m. on the first business day after the date of signing the contract of sale; it’s incredibly important.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s2\">When you plan to buy a house, it is important to protect your property against any possible risks. Building insurance usually gives you coverage against any damage that may occur due to rainwater, fire and most natural disasters. It covers items such as air conditioners, switches, cables, pipes, light fittings, hot water system and more. In many cases, gates and fences are also covered in the insurance contract. It also provides coverage of valuable items like washing machines, furniture and computers.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s2\">Many insurance companies design discounted bundles that allow you to get coverage for the building and the belongings too.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s2\"><b>How Much Should You Insure for?</b></span></p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s2\">This is a critical answer that has to be decided when it comes to organising building insurance. Building insurance will cover the labour and raw material cost that is required to rebuild the house if it gets destroyed by any natural disaster or other reasons.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s2\">Normally, an insurance company estimates the insurance amount in two ways:</span></p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li6\"><span class=\"s2\">It evaluates the condition of different building elements to compute the rebuilding cost. This gives the insurer an idea about how much the cost (labour and raw material) of what they need to reconstruct the building will be.</span></li>\n<li class=\"li6\"><span class=\"s2\">The company uses a cost per square metre method, which gives a rough estimate of the material used and the size of the building.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s2\">Underinsuring is a very common problem in Australia. If you are buying a house in a high-risk area where floods or forest fires are common, it is better to get a correct estimate of how much you should get to receive complete coverage in case of a disaster.</span></p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_8092\" style=\"width: 950px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-8092\" class=\"size-full wp-image-8092\" src=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fhog-fire.jpg\" alt=\"fhog-fire\" width=\"940\" height=\"627\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-8092\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Home &amp; Contents insure protects you from Fire &amp; Theft.</p></div><br />\n</p>\n<div class=\"hub_pr_n_arrows\"><i class=\"fa fa-angle-left\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i></div>\n<div class=\"hub_previous\">Previous</div>\n<div class=\"hub_previous_link\"><a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/hub/finalise-settlement/get-formal-approval/\">Get formal approval</a></div>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"hub_pr_n_arrows\"><i class=\"fa fa-angle-right\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i></div>\n<div class=\"hub_next\">Next</div>\n<div class=\"hub_next_link\"><a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/hub/finalise-settlement/arrange-building-pest-inspection/\">Arrange building &#038; pest inspection</a></div>\n<p><link rel='stylesheet' href='https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/OwlCarousel2/2.1.3/assets/owl.carousel.min.css'><script src='https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/OwlCarousel2/2.1.3/owl.carousel.min.js'></script><script src='https://use.fontawesome.com/826a7e3dce.js'></script></p>\n<style>.carousel-wrap { margin: 90px auto; padding: 0 5%; width: 80%; position: relative;}/* fix blank or flashing items on carousel */.owl-carousel .item { position: relative; z-index: 100;  -webkit-backface-visibility: hidden; }/* end fix */.owl-nav > div { margin-top: -26px; position: absolute; top: 50%; color: #cdcbcd;}.owl-nav i { font-size: 52px;}.owl-nav .owl-prev { left: -30px;}.owl-nav .owl-next { right: -30px;}</style>\n<p><script>jQuery('.owl-carousel').owlCarousel({ loop: true, margin: 10, nav: true, navText:  --> \"<i class='fa fa-caret-left'></i>\", \"<i class='fa fa-caret-right'></i>\" ], autoplay: false, autoplayHoverPause: false, responsive: { 0: { items: 1 }, 600: { items: 3 }, 1000: { items: 3 } }})</script></p>"

Following is a list of information you will normally find in a contract of sale:</span></p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>☑️</strong>Certificate of the title information</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>☑️</strong>Offer date</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>☑️</strong>Warnings, such as the necessity for smoke alarms</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>☑️</strong>Settlement date of an intended property</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>☑️</strong>The cooling-off period</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>☑️</strong>Information about furnishing and fixtures</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>☑️</strong>Improvements to the property</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>☑️</strong>Property address</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>☑️</strong>Loan details, such as the terms and conditions of the payment, and initial deposit</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>☑️</strong>The price of the property</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>☑️</strong>Name of the seller</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>☑️</strong>Purchasing party information</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>☑️</strong>Information about the selling agent</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Normally the special conditions are included in the contract of sale that can override the general conditions of the contract. Therefore, don’t sign the contract until you are fully aware of all the terms and conditions. The seller is required to attach the following with the contract of sale:</span></p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>☑️</strong>Notification about the defects</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>☑️</strong>Warranties</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>☑️</strong>Sale conditions</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>☑️</strong>Disclosure documents</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>☑️</strong>Cooling-off notice</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>☑️</strong>Warranty insurance certification</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>☑️</strong>Easement and restriction documentation</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>☑️</strong>Property certificates</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>☑️</strong>Zoning certificates</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>☑️</strong>Plans of sewer lines</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If a seller fails to include these things, it gives a buyer the right to cancel the contract within a certain period of time.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Details of different contracts across Australia</b></span></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s4\">🇦🇺</span><span class=\"s1\"> Victoria</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The Instrument’s Act 1958 states that unless you honour a contract of sales in full, a verbal agreement is not binding.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Before signing a contract of sale, the seller is bound to provide the potential purchase with the seller’s statement. Both parties sign each contract’s copy and exchange it through a real estate agent. The cooling off period in Victoria is 3 days.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s4\">🇦🇺</span><span class=\"s1\"> New South Wales</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In New South Wales and Sydney, you cannot sell a residential property without signing a contract of sale. Many changes have occurred in these states. For example, a seller of strata scheme or a single freehold is also required to provide a valid non-compliance certificate, an occupation certificate, and a valid compliance certificate.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Moreover, the vendor and purchase are under no obligation to honour the contract until they exchange signed copies. These copies can be exchanged in a face to face meeting or via mail. The cooling off period in New South Wales is 5 days.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s4\">🇦🇺</span><span class=\"s1\"> Queensland </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In Queensland, the cooling off period is 5 days and the following information should be included in the contract for it to be valid: If the contract is terminated by the purchaser during a statutory cooling-off phase, they will be bound to pay a penalty of 0.25% of the purchase price. Therefore, it is advised that a purchaser should do a property valuation independently and seek legal advice regarding cooling-off rights and the contract before signing a contract.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In these states, the contract is signed by the buyer first, and the seller only signs it if he accepts the offer. It becomes binding only after the buyer receives an acceptance notification.

The sooner you move on from it, the faster you will find something better, and while it’s not nice to think of yourself as a loser in the auction, it’s much better to walk away to find a better home than overcommit to a property that you’ve become emotionally blinded by.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As the saying goes in real estate, ‘The money is made when you buy, not when you sell’. In other words, the price you pay for the property is the main factor to determine how much profit you make later on.</span></p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_8288\" style=\"width: 722px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-8288\" class=\"size-full wp-image-8288\" src=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/rp-data-comparable-sales-paddington.png\" alt=\"rp data comparable sales paddington\" width=\"712\" height=\"779\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-8288\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A list of recently sold homes in Brisbane, as you can see there is always going to be another home!</p></div><br />\n</p>\n<div class=\"hub_pr_n_arrows\"><i class=\"fa fa-angle-left\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i></div>\n<div class=\"hub_previous\">Previous</div>\n<div class=\"hub_previous_link\"><a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/hub/buy-at-auction/take-it-slow-when-bidding/\">Take it slow when bidding</a></div>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"hub_pr_n_arrows\"><i class=\"fa fa-angle-right\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i></div>\n<div class=\"hub_next\">Next</div>\n<div class=\"hub_next_link\"><a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/hub/buy-at-auction/11-point-auction-bidding-checklist/\">11 point Auction bidding checklist</a></div>\n<p><link rel='stylesheet' href='https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/OwlCarousel2/2.1.3/assets/owl.carousel.min.css'><script src='https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/OwlCarousel2/2.1.3/owl.carousel.min.js'></script><script src='https://use.fontawesome.com/826a7e3dce.js'></script></p>\n<style>.carousel-wrap { margin: 90px auto; padding: 0 5%; width: 80%; position: relative;}/* fix blank or flashing items on carousel */.owl-carousel .item { position: relative; z-index: 100;  -webkit-backface-visibility: hidden; }/* end fix */.owl-nav > div { margin-top: -26px; position: absolute; top: 50%; color: #cdcbcd;}.owl-nav i { font-size: 52px;}.owl-nav .owl-prev { left: -30px;}.owl-nav .owl-next { right: -30px;}</style>\n<p><script>jQuery('.owl-carousel').owlCarousel({ loop: true, margin: 10, nav: true, navText:  --> \"<i class='fa fa-caret-left'></i>\", \"<i class='fa fa-caret-right'></i>\" ], autoplay: false, autoplayHoverPause: false, responsive: { 0: { items: 1 }, 600: { items: 3 }, 1000: { items: 3 } }})</script></p>"

For example, say ‘Four hundred and fifty-seven thousand dollars’ instead of waving your hand and saying ‘seven’ (i.e. indicating that you’re raising the current bid by $7,000).</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When you say it, be confident and make sure everyone hears it. It reminds people how much they’re paying for the property and can turn off other bidders if they’re close to their budget.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_8325\" style=\"width: 940px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-8325\" class=\"size-full wp-image-8325\" src=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/buying-at-auction.jpg\" alt=\"buying-at-auction\" width=\"930\" height=\"500\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-8325\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Being prepared is half the battle when going to auction!</p></div>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Try not to bid until the property is announced to be on the market, or until there has been a vendor (seller’s) bid moving the price closer to reserve. By doing this it might take a bit of momentum out of the auction.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If there are no genuine bids and it looks like the auctioneer will pass the property in, make sure you bid as it gives you the exclusive opportunity to negotiate with the vendor after the auction. At a minimum, put in a low-ball offer to secure this right.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b><i>Keep your price to yourself</i></b></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Always set a budget and stick to it, and never tell the real estate agent.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10139\" src=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/buy-at-auction-1-1024x768.png\" alt=\"buy at auction\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" />From experience, slightly higher and uneven numbers can make really good budgets (and give you a competitive advantage!).</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For example, say you think a property is worth $450,000—and a few other people, including your competition, could have also set this number as their budget. If you set your budget at $457,500 it could be enough to put you slightly ahead and win the property at auction!</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Auctions are a pretty foreign experience for most of us and can be quite scary. If you’re emotionally connected with the property or not a confident bidder, get a friend or family member to bid for you. Even better, you can use the services of a reputable buyer’s agent to bid for you as they have plenty of experience (<a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/contact/\"><span class=\"s3\">we can recommend a buyer’s agent if you need</span></a>).</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Property expert John McGrath recommends controlling the momentum of the auction to your advantage, saying, <i>‘Sometimes it’s advantageous to slow an auction down and ask the agent to accept smaller increased bids. Other times it’s better to make higher, more confident bids to “scare” other purchasers and kill any momentum. Only experience can tell you what to do here but the point is—there’s no hard and fast rule.’</i></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Lastly, make sure you stand in a good position where the agent can see you clearly, and where you can spot all the other bidders in the crowd. Try as much as possible to look confident and relaxed (which is more often easier said than done)—and in the blink of an eye you’ll be hearing ‘going, going, sold’!</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"hub_pr_n_arrows\"><i class=\"fa fa-angle-left\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i></div>\n<div class=\"hub_previous\">Previous</div>\n<div class=\"hub_previous_link\"><a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/hub/buy-at-auction/buy-at-auction/\">Buy at auction</a></div>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"hub_pr_n_arrows\"><i class=\"fa fa-angle-right\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i></div>\n<div class=\"hub_next\">Next</div>\n<div class=\"hub_next_link\"><a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/hub/buy-at-auction/be-prepared-to-walk-away/\">Be prepared to walk away</a></div>\n<p><link rel='stylesheet' href='https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/OwlCarousel2/2.1.3/assets/owl.carousel.min.css'><script src='https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/OwlCarousel2/2.1.3/owl.carousel.min.js'></script><script src='https://use.fontawesome.com/826a7e3dce.js'></script></p>\n<style>.carousel-wrap { margin: 90px auto; padding: 0 5%; width: 80%; position: relative;}/* fix blank or flashing items on carousel */.owl-carousel .item { position: relative; z-index: 100;  -webkit-backface-visibility: hidden; }/* end fix */.owl-nav > div { margin-top: -26px; position: absolute; top: 50%; color: #cdcbcd;}.owl-nav i { font-size: 52px;}.owl-nav .owl-prev { left: -30px;}.owl-nav .owl-next { right: -30px;}</style>\n<p><script>jQuery('.owl-carousel').owlCarousel({ loop: true, margin: 10, nav: true, navText:  --> \"<i class='fa fa-caret-left'></i>\", \"<i class='fa fa-caret-right'></i>\" ], autoplay: false, autoplayHoverPause: false, responsive: { 0: { items: 1 }, 600: { items: 3 }, 1000: { items: 3 } }})</script></p>"

Buying a home is stressful enough. When you’re buying at auction, you have the added stress of the auction itself. Worst case scenario is that you overbid at auction and end up stuck with a house at a price you can’t actually afford.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NS-GAzN7-Yw?feature=oembed&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;rel=0&amp;color=WHITE\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">An auction is a public sale, where potential buyers submit bids in order to buy a property which is sold to the highest bidder. Auctions are common in a competitive property market because it is seen to increase the competitiveness of a sale by getting all the serious buyers in one place and seen to sell the property faster than with a private sale. At an auction you do not get a <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/buying-at-auction/#Is_there_a_cooling_off_period\"><span class=\"s2\">cooling-off period</span></a>, so a sold property at auction is final.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s3\">For the savvy home-buyer, auctions also represent a great opportunity. </span><span class=\"s1\">First home buyers can buy at auction, and it can present good buying opportunities because most first home buyers are scared to buy at auction given it can be quite daunting. You can try to negotiate with the real estate agent before the auction to secure the home, but failing that you should have your finance in place to be able to buy at auction.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In this chapter, you’ll learn all about auctions and how they work. We’re going to give you the ammunition so you can come to the auction fully prepared and ready to win.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8478 \" src=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/TIPS-FOR-BUYING-AUCTION1.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 531px) 100vw, 531px\" srcset=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/TIPS-FOR-BUYING-AUCTION1.png 940w, https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/TIPS-FOR-BUYING-AUCTION1-300x251.png 300w, https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/TIPS-FOR-BUYING-AUCTION1-768x644.png 768w\" alt=\"TIPS-FOR-BUYING-AUCTION1\" width=\"531\" height=\"445\" /></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Remember, real estate agents can sometimes try to undervalue a property when bringing it to auction to draw a large crowd of buyers, so before the auction, work out your maximum value that you will walk away from the property… but more on this in a minute.</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"hub_pr_n_arrows\"><i class=\"fa fa-angle-left\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i></div>\n<div class=\"hub_previous\">Previous</div>\n<div class=\"hub_previous_link\"><a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/hub/make-an-offer/\">Make an offer</a></div>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"hub_pr_n_arrows\"><i class=\"fa fa-angle-right\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i></div>\n<div class=\"hub_next\">Next</div>\n<div class=\"hub_next_link\"><a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/hub/buy-at-auction/understand-the-auction-mindset/\">Understand the auction mindset</a></div>\n<p><link rel='stylesheet' href='https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/OwlCarousel2/2.1.3/assets/owl.carousel.min.css'><script src='https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/OwlCarousel2/2.1.3/owl.carousel.min.js'></script><script src='https://use.fontawesome.com/826a7e3dce.js'></script></p>\n<style>.carousel-wrap { margin: 90px auto; padding: 0 5%; width: 80%; position: relative;}/* fix blank or flashing items on carousel */.owl-carousel .item { position: relative; z-index: 100;  -webkit-backface-visibility: hidden; }/* end fix */.owl-nav > div { margin-top: -26px; position: absolute; top: 50%; color: #cdcbcd;}.owl-nav i { font-size: 52px;}.owl-nav .owl-prev { left: -30px;}.owl-nav .owl-next { right: -30px;}</style>\n<p><script>jQuery('.owl-carousel').owlCarousel({ loop: true, margin: 10, nav: true, navText:  --> \"<i class='fa fa-caret-left'></i>\", \"<i class='fa fa-caret-right'></i>\" ], autoplay: false, autoplayHoverPause: false, responsive: { 0: { items: 1 }, 600: { items: 3 }, 1000: { items: 3 } }})</script></p>"

And more importantly, it’s critical for you to maintain your independence when it comes to getting reports and researching facts about the property.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Remember a good real estate agent will work hard for the seller to get the best price so they aren’t working for you as the buyer, and most agents are paid commission to sell the property. You need to put your best foot forward, and by asking the right questions you can quickly identify potential issues on the property, get a better idea on the value of the property and the seller’s motivations, and make an offer that will put you way ahead of your competition.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\"><a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/first-home-buyer-guide/#questions-to-ask-real-estate-agent\"><b>Questions to Ask a Real Estate Agent</b></a></span></p>\n<ol class=\"ol1\">\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Why are the vendors (sellers) selling the property?</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">How long has the property been for sale?</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Are the sellers willing to take offers before the auction?</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Have any other offers been received?</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Have any of these offers been refused?</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Have the owners bought another property?</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Regardless of whether you feel comfortable with the real estate agent, the important thing is to tell them almost nothing.</span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-8226\" src=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/west-end-home.jpg\" alt=\"west end home\" width=\"700\" height=\"392\" /></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Just ask lots of questions, and don’t give them information that they can use to get more money from you—they may ask how much you have been pre-approved for, the amount you have for your deposit, or if you currently own a property.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Stay strong and answer any of their questions by saying you have finance approved and a good deposit in place.</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"hub_pr_n_arrows\"><i class=\"fa fa-angle-left\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i></div>\n<div class=\"hub_previous\">Previous</div>\n<div class=\"hub_previous_link\"><a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/hub/buy-at-auction/know-your-competition/\">Know your competition</a></div>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"hub_pr_n_arrows\"><i class=\"fa fa-angle-right\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i></div>\n<div class=\"hub_next\">Next</div>\n<div class=\"hub_next_link\"><a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/hub/buy-at-auction/take-it-slow-when-bidding/\">Take it slow when bidding</a></div>\n<p><link rel='stylesheet' href='https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/OwlCarousel2/2.1.3/assets/owl.carousel.min.css'><script src='https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/OwlCarousel2/2.1.3/owl.carousel.min.js'></script><script src='https://use.fontawesome.com/826a7e3dce.js'></script></p>\n<style>.carousel-wrap { margin: 90px auto; padding: 0 5%; width: 80%; position: relative;}/* fix blank or flashing items on carousel */.owl-carousel .item { position: relative; z-index: 100;  -webkit-backface-visibility: hidden; }/* end fix */.owl-nav > div { margin-top: -26px; position: absolute; top: 50%; color: #cdcbcd;}.owl-nav i { font-size: 52px;}.owl-nav .owl-prev { left: -30px;}.owl-nav .owl-next { right: -30px;}</style>\n<p><script>jQuery('.owl-carousel').owlCarousel({ loop: true, margin: 10, nav: true, navText:  --> \"<i class='fa fa-caret-left'></i>\", \"<i class='fa fa-caret-right'></i>\" ], autoplay: false, autoplayHoverPause: false, responsive: { 0: { items: 1 }, 600: { items: 3 }, 1000: { items: 3 } }})</script></p>"

Some home buyers will try to save a few hundred dollars by skipping building and pest reports, or checking contract with solicitors and can literally risk thousands of dollars. Don’t let this happen to you.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If you have found the right home and it’s being sold at auction you need to consult a <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/hidden-costs-buying-home-brisbane/#legal-fees-when-buying-home\"><span class=\"s2\">lawyer (or solicitor)</span></a> before you sign anything. At the end of the day, the home will cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, and a <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/hidden-costs-buying-home-brisbane/#legal-fees-when-buying-home\"><span class=\"s2\">lawyer</span></a> could cost a few hundred but will provide you priceless independent advice to double check the contract and make sure there aren’t any odd terms and conditions in there.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The same goes for your <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/\"><span class=\"s2\">mortgage broker.</span></a> You want to make sure you have a reliable pre-approval in place that fits with the maximum amount you will bid at auction. It’s also important that you have the <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/mistakes-first-home-buyers-brisbane/#Overextending-getting-wrong-home-loan\"><span class=\"s2\">right type of home loan</span></a> that fits in with your goals both today and tomorrow.</span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-10135 size-large\" src=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Have-your-support-team-ready-1-1024x768.png\" alt=\"Have your support team ready (1)\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\"></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When you meet with your <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/\"><span class=\"s2\">mortgage broker</span></a> make sure you discuss the specific property that is going to auction; some banks have issues when properties have non-standard features like when the floor area is <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/pre-approval/\"><span class=\"s2\">under 50 square metres, and others have restrictions on certain suburbs and postcodes</span></a>. If you have discussed the property with the broker before the auction, and even ordered a valuation, you can be sure you are sitting in a strong financial position come auction day!</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>As a broad rule of thumb, make sure you double check with your </b><a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/mortgage-broker-brisbane/\"><span class=\"s2\"><b>mortgage broker</b></span></a><b> before buying any property that fits in these criteria:</b></span></p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>☑️</strong>Smaller than 50 square metres inside</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>☑️</strong>Land size over 2 hectares</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>☑️</strong>Doesn’t have standard title and zoning</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>☑️</strong>Not in a major town or city</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>☑️</strong>Includes incentives like furniture packages, or rental guarantees</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>☑️</strong>Is run down, or in disrepair and needs lots of work to fix up</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Buyers’ agents are real estate agents that represent you as a buyer, and they are becoming increasingly common these days. Buyers’ agents can help with sourcing, researching and even bidding on your behalf at auction. If you are nervous about bidding, living interstate or need some help with detailed analysis on the property, a buyer’s agent could be a good option to consider. They generally charge a fixed percentage fee on the purchase price, and this can range from $2000 to $10,000, depending on the property’s value.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_8178\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-8178\" class=\"wp-image-8178 size-full\" src=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Buyers-Agent-VS-Selling-Agent.png\" alt=\"Buyers-Agent-VS-Selling-Agent\" width=\"600\" height=\"300\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-8178\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Understanding the selling agents role can help with your negotiations and get you a better result.</p></div>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">And finally, <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/hidden-costs-buying-home-brisbane/#building-pest-reports-home-owners\"><span class=\"s2\">building and pest reports</span></a> to look at the building (structural soundness) and pests are what I would consider a mandatory cost when buying a home.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Should I Use the Building and Pest Report Supplied by the Real Estate Agent?</b></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">While these <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/hidden-costs-buying-home-brisbane/#building-pest-reports-home-owners\"><span class=\"s2\">building and pest reports</span></a> are generally completed by third parties, it was completed under the instruction of the real estate agent who is employed by the seller to sell the property.

This is because they cannot know how high the bidding will go. A property may appear on a listing website when you search by price. This is only for the purposes of the web search and is not designed as a price guide.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Luckily for you (if you’ve been reading this book in order), you already know the best ways to value a property accurately.

The first is to try to sell the property as quickly as possible. A property for sale at auction that has just been listed on the market involves three weeks of heavy campaigning with the auction taking place in the fourth week.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The second reason a real estate agent puts a property to auction is to try to flush out buyers by putting that four-week deadline on the property, and create a sense of competition to increase the sale price of the property.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Auctions are very common in rising property markets, where there is increased competition and situations where there are multiple buyers for the one property. For this reason, it is critical that at an auction you set a budget beforehand and stick with it. If you are a success at auction and win, you will have to settle the contract even if you can’t afford it. If the property fails to meet the reserve price it is passed in, which means it won’t be sold at auction. The good news is if you were the highest bidder at auction you have the first opportunity to negotiate with the seller.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_8086\" style=\"width: 868px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-8086\" class=\"wp-image-8086 size-full\" src=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Brisbane-Mortgage-Broker-home.jpg\" alt=\"Brisbane-Mortgage-Broker-home\" width=\"858\" height=\"573\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-8086\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Auctions in Brisbane are becoming increasingly common.</p></div>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In Queensland to be eligible to buy at auction, you need to be a registered bidder. In order to register you need to provide the selling real estate agent with a copy of your Australian driver’s licence around 10 – 15 minutes before the auction is set to take place. In some other states like Victoria and Western Australia, there is no requirement for you to make yourself known to the <a href=\"https://www.qld.gov.au/law/fair-trading\"><span class=\"s2\">auctioneer</span></a> before sticking your hand in the air!</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The real estate agent will give you a unique bidder’s number (a paddle with a number at the top), which you can hold up during the auction to make an offer to buy the property.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If the property meets the reserve price, and you are the highest bidder at the fall of the auctioneer’s hammer, then you have now bought a property!</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When buying at auction there is no <a href=\"https://www.qld.gov.au/law/housing-and-neighbours/buying-and-selling-a-property/buying-a-home/making-an-offer-on-a-home/cooling-off-period\"><span class=\"s2\">cooling-off period</span></a>, meaning if you buy the property it is final and you cannot get out of it. The cooling-off period also does not apply if you sign a contract on the property within two days of an unsuccessful auction of that property, or after being a registered bidder on the auction. So be careful; if you are unsuccessful at auction but end up signing a contract of sale after you may have waived your cooling-off period!</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">There are a few terms that you may come across during the auction process. Here’s a quick explanation so you can be confident that you know what you’re talking about if these terms are mentioned:</p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b><strong>☑️</strong>Reserve price:</b> This is the lowest price that the seller will accept at auction. The seller sets the reserve price with the auctioneer before the auction in writing, and while the real estate agent or auctioneer isn’t allowed to tell you the reserve price they can say during the auction if the reserve price has been met.</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b><strong>☑️</strong>The successful bidder:</b> The successful bidder is the person who meets the property’s reserve price and wins at auction. If you are the successful bidder you need to sign the contract immediately, which is legally binding. There are serious legal consequences if you cannot settle the property on time including the full price of the property, the cost of re-auctioning the property and any shortfall on your office and the winning bid at the next auction.</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b><strong>☑️</strong>Vendor bids:</b> During auctions in Queensland an auctioneer can accept a seller (or vendor) bid to increase the current bid all the way up to the reserve price. Prior to the current bid reaching the reserve price, the auctioneer can bid on behalf of the seller, or accept bids from the seller (or their representing real estate agent). This is a way to keep the auction moving, and increase the bid closer to the reserve price—if you hear a vendor bid you know the reserve price has not been reached yet.</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b><strong>☑️</strong>Dummy bids:</b> A dummy bid is a way to increase the bidding during an auction by the seller, a family member or friend, or any other individual that isn’t a serious buyer. In Queensland, and across Australia, dummy bids are illegal and should be reported as they artificially inflate the price of the property at auction.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"hub_pr_n_arrows\"><i class=\"fa fa-angle-left\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i></div>\n<div class=\"hub_previous\">Previous</div>\n<div class=\"hub_previous_link\"><a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/hub/buy-at-auction/\">Buy at Auction</a></div>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"hub_pr_n_arrows\"><i class=\"fa fa-angle-right\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i></div>\n<div class=\"hub_next\">Next</div>\n<div class=\"hub_next_link\"><a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/hub/buy-at-auction/know-the-propertys-value/\">Know the property’s value</a></div>\n<p><link rel='stylesheet' href='https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/OwlCarousel2/2.1.3/assets/owl.carousel.min.css'><script src='https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/OwlCarousel2/2.1.3/owl.carousel.min.js'></script><script src='https://use.fontawesome.com/826a7e3dce.js'></script></p>\n<style>.carousel-wrap { margin: 90px auto; padding: 0 5%; width: 80%; position: relative;}/* fix blank or flashing items on carousel */.owl-carousel .item { position: relative; z-index: 100;  -webkit-backface-visibility: hidden; }/* end fix */.owl-nav > div { margin-top: -26px; position: absolute; top: 50%; color: #cdcbcd;}.owl-nav i { font-size: 52px;}.owl-nav .owl-prev { left: -30px;}.owl-nav .owl-next { right: -30px;}</style>\n<p><script>jQuery('.owl-carousel').owlCarousel({ loop: true, margin: 10, nav: true, navText:  --> \"<i class='fa fa-caret-left'></i>\", \"<i class='fa fa-caret-right'></i>\" ], autoplay: false, autoplayHoverPause: false, responsive: { 0: { items: 1 }, 600: { items: 3 }, 1000: { items: 3 } }})</script></p>"

by failing to prepare you are preparing to fail.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Although it might take you weeks to research and prepare to make your offer on a property, it could be rejected and over in a matter of minutes.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">You still need to spend time preparing your figures and hope for the best that the vendor is willing to negotiate – but also be prepared to miss out if they are being unreasonable on price.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Ultimately you need to stick with your walk-away price, after all, you’ve done your homework and you know what that particular property is worth to you.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">As the saying goes in Real Estate, ‘The Money is Made when you Buy, Not When You Sell’ in other words, the price you pay for the property is the main factor to determine how

And when you are buying an older property like a Queenslander in Brisbane, it’s common for there to be small problems around the property.</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">🏚</span> Cracked glass, broken windows</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">🏚</span> Wet rot to cabinets in bathroom and kitchen sink</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">🏚</span> Insufficient drainage</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\">Provided the problems aren’t structural you can use these to negotiate a lower house price EVEN AFTER you’ve signed a contract of sale. Let’s look at this example:</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_8615\" style=\"width: 719px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-8615\" class=\"wp-image-8615 size-full\" src=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/building_inspection_report_pdf.png\" alt=\"Building_Inspection_Report_pdf\" width=\"709\" height=\"648\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-8615\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">There are lots of problems with this property, but they are mostly superficial.</p></div>\n<p class=\"p5\">While it might look like these are scary problems, after talking with a builder the owner found out it would only cost between $2,000 to $3,000 to fix.</p>\n<p class=\"p5\">They used this to go back to the real estate agent and negotiate a further $10,000 off the price!</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"hub_pr_n_arrows\"><i class=\"fa fa-angle-left\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i></div>\n<div class=\"hub_previous\">Previous</div>\n<div class=\"hub_previous_link\"><a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/hub/make-an-offer/prepare-your-counter-offer/\">Prepare your counter offer</a></div>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"hub_pr_n_arrows\"><i class=\"fa fa-angle-right\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i></div>\n<div class=\"hub_next\">Next</div>\n<div class=\"hub_next_link\"><a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/hub/make-an-offer/be-ready-to-walk-away/\">Be ready to walk away</a></div>\n<p><link rel='stylesheet' href='https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/OwlCarousel2/2.1.3/assets/owl.carousel.min.css'><script src='https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/OwlCarousel2/2.1.3/owl.carousel.min.js'></script><script src='https://use.fontawesome.com/826a7e3dce.js'></script></p>\n<style>.carousel-wrap { margin: 90px auto; padding: 0 5%; width: 80%; position: relative;}/* fix blank or flashing items on carousel */.owl-carousel .item { position: relative; z-index: 100;  -webkit-backface-visibility: hidden; }/* end fix */.owl-nav > div { margin-top: -26px; position: absolute; top: 50%; color: #cdcbcd;}.owl-nav i { font-size: 52px;}.owl-nav .owl-prev { left: -30px;}.owl-nav .owl-next { right: -30px;}</style>\n<p><script>jQuery('.owl-carousel').owlCarousel({ loop: true, margin: 10, nav: true, navText:  --> \"<i class='fa fa-caret-left'></i>\", \"<i class='fa fa-caret-right'></i>\" ], autoplay: false, autoplayHoverPause: false, responsive: { 0: { items: 1 }, 600: { items: 3 }, 1000: { items: 3 } }})</script></p>"

These are approachable and non-threatening questions leading with “What” and “How”. An advanced technique is to ask the same question three different ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">✅</span> What are the sellers doing after they move out?</li>\n<li><span class=\"s1\">✅</span> What are the vendors plans once they sell?</li>\n<li><span class=\"s1\">✅</span> How soon are the vendors looking to sell?</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\">This method gives the Real Estate agent time to think, and possibly let slip some information that can help your negotiations.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">We covered the key questions to ask the Real Estate agent in Chapter 6, but let’s quickly recap. Here’s what you need to ask:</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">1. What are the vendors reasons for selling the property?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">2. How long has the property been for sale?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">3. What was the original asking price?</p>\n<p>4. How negotiable are the sellers on price?</p>\n<p>5. What do you think the lower price they are willing to accept?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">A good real estate agent will work hard for the seller to get the best possible price. So you need to remember that the Real Estate agent, while helpful, isn’t working for you.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-10126 size-large\" src=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Ask-open-ended-1-1024x768.png\" alt=\"Ask open-ended questions\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In other words, you need to consider the Real Estate agent’s motivations.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">✅</span> 1. They want to be able to sell the property at the best price</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">✅</span> 2. They want to be able to sell the property in the shortest timeframe possible.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Ideally even before the property hits the market, that way they don’t even need to do an open inspection!</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Thinking about the real estate agent’s motivations can help you better position your offer, and remember when dealing with Real Estate agents try to use open “how and “what” questions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"hub_pr_n_arrows\"><i class=\"fa fa-angle-left\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i></div>\n<div class=\"hub_previous\">Previous</div>\n<div class=\"hub_previous_link\"><a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/hub/make-an-offer/negotiation-fundamentals/\">Negotiation fundamentals</a></div>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"hub_pr_n_arrows\"><i class=\"fa fa-angle-right\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i></div>\n<div class=\"hub_next\">Next</div>\n<div class=\"hub_next_link\"><a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/hub/make-an-offer/making-your-first-offer/\">Making your first offer</a></div>\n<p><link rel='stylesheet' href='https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/OwlCarousel2/2.1.3/assets/owl.carousel.min.css'><script src='https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/OwlCarousel2/2.1.3/owl.carousel.min.js'></script><script src='https://use.fontawesome.com/826a7e3dce.js'></script></p>\n<style>.carousel-wrap { margin: 90px auto; padding: 0 5%; width: 80%; position: relative;}/* fix blank or flashing items on carousel */.owl-carousel .item { position: relative; z-index: 100;  -webkit-backface-visibility: hidden; }/* end fix */.owl-nav > div { margin-top: -26px; position: absolute; top: 50%; color: #cdcbcd;}.owl-nav i { font-size: 52px;}.owl-nav .owl-prev { left: -30px;}.owl-nav .owl-next { right: -30px;}</style>\n<p><script>jQuery('.owl-carousel').owlCarousel({ loop: true, margin: 10, nav: true, navText:  --> \"<i class='fa fa-caret-left'></i>\", \"<i class='fa fa-caret-right'></i>\" ], autoplay: false, autoplayHoverPause: false, responsive: { 0: { items: 1 }, 600: { items: 3 }, 1000: { items: 3 } }})</script></p>"

When you are buying a house, everything is negotiable.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_8604\" style=\"width: 514px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-8604\" class=\"wp-image-8604 size-full\" src=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/how-negotiation-works.jpg\" alt=\"how negotiation works\" width=\"504\" height=\"372\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-8604\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">We negotiate every day… from a better salary to getting the kids to sleep early.</p></div>\n<p class=\"p5\">Knowledge is power when you negotiate. And finding out why the vendor is selling can give you powerful information to better position your offer, this is building on the questions you have asked the real estate agent in the previous chapter.</p>\n<p class=\"p5\">For example, if the seller has bought another house and is pushed for time you could use a shorter settlement period as a sweetener on a discounted price.</p>\n<p class=\"p5\">Looking at shorter settlement terms, or other finance conditions can save you thousands.</p>\n<p class=\"p5\">The sellers could be juggling two houses and need to sell quickly… This could be an opportunity for you to buy a house at a discount.</p>\n<p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s1\"><b> </b>Last but not the least, devise and follow the right negotiation strategy. Instead of making the </span><span class=\"s1\" style=\"font-size: 1.125rem;\">offer first, let the seller come up with the price. This will give you a clear idea of what the seller </span><span class=\"s1\" style=\"font-size: 1.125rem;\">is expecting and how much you can negotiate. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"font-size: 1.125rem;\">For example, if you make an offer to purchase the </span><span class=\"s1\" style=\"font-size: 1.125rem;\">house at $600,000 when the advertised price of a house is $650,000 and the seller was willing to </span><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">sell it for $550,000, you will end up losing $50,000 that could have been saved had you not </span><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">initiated the offer.</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"hub_pr_n_arrows\"><i class=\"fa fa-angle-left\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i></div>\n<div class=\"hub_previous\">Previous</div>\n<div class=\"hub_previous_link\"><a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/hub/make-an-offer/have-confidence-with-your-research-and-finances/\">Have confidence with your research and finances</a></div>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"hub_pr_n_arrows\"><i class=\"fa fa-angle-right\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i></div>\n<div class=\"hub_next\">Next</div>\n<div class=\"hub_next_link\"><a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/hub/make-an-offer/ask-open-ended-what-and-how-questions/\">Ask open-ended “What?” And “How?” questions</a></div>\n<p><link rel='stylesheet' href='https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/OwlCarousel2/2.1.3/assets/owl.carousel.min.css'><script src='https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/OwlCarousel2/2.1.3/owl.carousel.min.js'></script><script src='https://use.fontawesome.com/826a7e3dce.js'></script></p>\n<style>.carousel-wrap { margin: 90px auto; padding: 0 5%; width: 80%; position: relative;}/* fix blank or flashing items on carousel */.owl-carousel .item { position: relative; z-index: 100;  -webkit-backface-visibility: hidden; }/* end fix */.owl-nav > div { margin-top: -26px; position: absolute; top: 50%; color: #cdcbcd;}.owl-nav i { font-size: 52px;}.owl-nav .owl-prev { left: -30px;}.owl-nav .owl-next { right: -30px;}</style>\n<p><script>jQuery('.owl-carousel').owlCarousel({ loop: true, margin: 10, nav: true, navText:  --> \"<i class='fa fa-caret-left'></i>\", \"<i class='fa fa-caret-right'></i>\" ], autoplay: false, autoplayHoverPause: false, responsive: { 0: { items: 1 }, 600: { items: 3 }, 1000: { items: 3 } }})</script></p>"

It&#8217;s a collection of hand-picked resources to help you master negotiation tactics and learn how to negotiate a house price with a real estate agent. I will show you how you can remove the stress from this process and confidently offer a fair price for your house.</span></p>\n<h2><strong>Have confidence with your research and finances</strong></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">When you start to negotiate the house price, you want to have complete confidence in your research, home loan and finances. Here’s what you should have as a minimum before you come to the negotiation table:</p>\n<p><b>☑️A pre-approved home loan:</b> you want to know the maximum amount you can afford before you start actively negotiating on price. If you&#8217;ve been following this guide step-by-step, you should already have a pre-approval. Even so, at this stage, it’s worth checking back in with your mortgage broker to confirm the specifics of your pre-approval and make sure it is still valid as we covered in Chapter 3.</p>\n<p><b>☑️Know the property’s value: </b>you can’t negotiate effectively without knowing how much the property is actually worth. If you’ve skipped this, go back to Chapter 5 and learn how to accurately value a property</p>\n<p><b>☑️Get a Building &amp; Pest Report moving (if you haven’t already):</b> A building and pest report is what I would consider one of the non-negotiable aspects of buying a house. These report cost between $400-600 and have literally saved me over 5 times from buying complete lemons of properties. The building &amp; pest report can take between 7-8 days to arrange and get back so its best to start looking for someone to help with this sooner rather than later. Head to Chapter 6 to learn more about building &amp; pest reports if necessary.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In order to a have a complete picture of the property you’re buying, you should also check the potential rental income, similar property sales, flood reports, commute times, and research the suburb and surrounding areas. Chapters 5 and 6 cover this in more detail, so head back there if you’ve missed anything.</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"hub_pr_n_arrows\"><i class=\"fa fa-angle-left\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i></div>\n<div class=\"hub_previous\">Previous</div>\n<div class=\"hub_previous_link\"><a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/hub/make-an-offer/\">Make an offert</a></div>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"hub_pr_n_arrows\"><i class=\"fa fa-angle-right\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i></div>\n<div class=\"hub_next\">Next</div>\n<div class=\"hub_next_link\"><a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/hub/make-an-offer/negotiation-fundamentals/\">Negotiation fundamentals</a></div>\n<p><link rel='stylesheet' href='https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/OwlCarousel2/2.1.3/assets/owl.carousel.min.css'><script src='https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/OwlCarousel2/2.1.3/owl.carousel.min.js'></script><script src='https://use.fontawesome.com/826a7e3dce.js'></script></p>\n<style>.carousel-wrap { margin: 90px auto; padding: 0 5%; width: 80%; position: relative;}/* fix blank or flashing items on carousel */.owl-carousel .item { position: relative; z-index: 100;  -webkit-backface-visibility: hidden; }/* end fix */.owl-nav > div { margin-top: -26px; position: absolute; top: 50%; color: #cdcbcd;}.owl-nav i { font-size: 52px;}.owl-nav .owl-prev { left: -30px;}.owl-nav .owl-next { right: -30px;}</style>\n<p><script>jQuery('.owl-carousel').owlCarousel({ loop: true, margin: 10, nav: true, navText:  --> \"<i class='fa fa-caret-left'></i>\", \"<i class='fa fa-caret-right'></i>\" ], autoplay: false, autoplayHoverPause: false, responsive: { 0: { items: 1 }, 600: { items: 3 }, 1000: { items: 3 } }})</script></p>"

They are employed by the person selling the property and they are legally (and I suppose morally) obligated to work for their client — the seller — and not you, the buyer.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I’ll be honest, I’ve made this mistake before and trusted the real estate agent by sharing a little bit too much information — on one occasion I told the agent that I only had a small 5% deposit. And while I could never confirm that’s the specific reason I missed out on purchasing that property, the fact that the real estate agent knew that could allow them to prioritise an offer with a larger deposit (larger deposit means a higher chance of getting the loan approved) over mine.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Either way, by misunderstanding the real estate agent’s role and giving them too much information I missed out on that property. With all that being said, it’s worth remembering that real estate agents can still be a good source of information.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>How to Deal With Real Estate Agents</b></span></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uAtyCc4UGCs?feature=oembed&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;rel=0&amp;color=WHITE\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe> </p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Remember, a good real estate agent will work hard for the seller to get the best price so they aren’t working for you as the buyer, and most agents are paid commission to sell the property — and as harsh as it might sound they won’t waste time on buyers who are unsure or unwilling to commit.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">You need to put your best foot forward, and by asking the right questions you can quickly identify potential issues on the property, get a better idea on the value of the property and the seller’s motivations, and make an offer that will put you way ahead of your competition</span></p>\n<ol class=\"ol1\">\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">The more the agent likes you, the more information they will give you.</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Find out as much as you can about the vendor, other competing buyers, and terms they are looking for.</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Asking questions allows you to position your offer strongly, without focusing on price.</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Try not to give away too much about your position, like the amount you have been pre-approved.</span></li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2 class=\"p2\"><b>Questions to ask a real estate agent </b></h2>\n<p class=\"p5\">1. <span class=\"s1\"><b>Why are they selling the property? </b></span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">This is a great starting point and gives you a solid understanding of the seller’s timeframes. Some real estate agents might not be comfortable discussing these details with you, but any information you can gain here gives you a better idea on what type of seller you are dealing with, and what items might help position your offer stronger than others.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">For example, a seller who has bought another property might be keen to sell their old property quicker and are less sensitive on the sale price. You could offer a lower price but with fewer days for due diligence or finance to put your offer ahead of others.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\">2. <span class=\"s1\"><b>How long has the property been for sale? </b></span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">The amount of time a property has been for sale on the market will ultimately influence its price. When a house is initially listed for sale it becomes an interesting property for both real estate </span>agents and prospective buyers for the first 14 – 21 days. If the house hasn’t been able to find a buyer after 60 days, it becomes stale and is generally much harder to sell because there is limited interest, there could be issues with the property or the price being asked is too high.</p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">For this reason, it’s important to take your time to find out why the property has been on the market for so long — maybe other buyers have struggled with finance? Have there been problems with valuations?</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_9631\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-9631\" class=\"wp-image-9631 size-full\" src=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/brisbane-best-suburb-to-live.jpg\" alt=\"brisbane best suburb to live\" width=\"800\" height=\"535\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-9631\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">It’s important to take your time to find out why the property has been on the market for so long.</p></div>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">On the other hand, some others are happy to wait years for an unrealistic price, while other sellers could be desperate to sell and may accept a low offer. Another thing to look out for is if the real estate agent’s contract to sell the property is about to expire (usually 90 days), then the agent will get onto your side to get the seller to accept a lower offer.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\">3. <span class=\"s1\"><b>What was the original asking price? </b></span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">It is worth asking the real estate agent what the original price range was on offer and getting a bit of a history on the sales campaign so far. You can ask them how many offers are made, and the prices being offered. If they were declined by the seller, or if they were accepted, why the deals fell through?</span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Investigating these areas gives you a clear idea of what the seller is expecting, and how much the previous interested buyers thought the house was worth. Asking these sorts of questions will present you as an informed buyer rather than a first timer!</span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\">4. <span class=\"s1\"><b>Are the sellers ready to negotiate on price? </b></span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">You might find a home you really want to purchase; that’s great! Don’t feel bad asking the real estate agent if the seller is ready to reduce the price — they could give you some valuable </span>information even before you make a deal. As a general rule of thumb, and depending on the location, Australian properties sell up to 10% less than their original asking price. This is known as vendor discounting; you can see what the average discount in your suburb is on <a href=\"https://www.evernote.com/OutboundRedirect.action?dest=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.corelogic.com.au%252Fsites%252Fdefault%252Ffiles%252F2018-03%252F2018-03-26--property-market-indicator-summary.pdf\"><span class=\"s3\">RP Data</span></a>.</p>\n<p class=\"p5\">5. <span class=\"s1\"><b>What’s the lowest price they are willing to accept?</b></span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Another worthwhile question to ask is the lowest amount the sellers will accept. In some cases, the real estate agent will just tell you — in others, they might give you a bit of a hint. The real reason in asking the question is to get a better understanding of the minimum price; if the real estate agent quotes $500,000 then you can understand whether</span><span class=\"s4\"> <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/free-assessment/\"><span class=\"s3\">you can really afford the property</span></a></span><span class=\"s1\">.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">We’ll be coming back to these questions in chapter 7, making an offer.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">We’ve put together the ultimate property research checklist to (1) research your suburb and surrounding area, (2) determine potential weekly rental and (3) calculate the property’s value.

You’re operating at a disadvantage; in a world where information is power, you’re up against people who have a lot more experience than you. There’s no single go-to place where you can get all of the information you need.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-10118 size-large\" src=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Do-your-research-1-1024x768.png\" alt=\"Do your research (1)\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" />If you don’t do your research, there’s a real risk of buying a home that is going to cost you thousands in repairs, or getting stuck with an un-sellable property because there’s something majorly wrong with it.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In an ideal world, you could just click a button and get a comprehensive report of every single detail about the property you’re about to buy. Unfortunately, it doesn’t quite work that way. However, in this chapter you’re going to get the next best thing: a simple process for researching and validating every important aspect of your potential new home.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Taking these extra steps does cost you time and money, but the payoff is massive.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rmDx57-gOsI?feature=oembed&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;rel=0&amp;color=WHITE\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><strong>Let’s look at an example.</strong></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">Charlotte reached out to us at Hunter Galloway to get a pre-approval for a home she was about to put an offer on. She had done a bit of research online, and had paid for a building and pest report to make sure there weren’t any major structural issues with the house. But she was missing a few critical pieces of the puzzle.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">As we got to talking, we found out that Charlotte hadn’t checked any <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/floodwise-property-report/\">flood reports</a>. We walked her through the process and it turns out that her property had a high risk of flooding in the future. Flood risks can drastically affect resale value, and insurance costs can be double or triple the normal amount. In the end, she went ahead with the property purchase, but was able to secure a significant discount off the asking price.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-8928 size-full\" src=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/flood-zones-brisbane-e1543374415873.jpg\" alt=\"flood zones brisbane\" width=\"786\" height=\"524\" /></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In the real estate game, information is absolutely everything.

These reports look at the building (structural soundness) and pests, to check you aren&#8217;t flatting with termites or white ants. I can say that building and pest reports have saved me over five times from buying complete dumps of properties.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_8149\" style=\"width: 835px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-8149\" class=\"wp-image-8149 size-full\" src=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/building-pests-in-brisbane.jpg\" alt=\"building pests in brisbane\" width=\"825\" height=\"474\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-8149\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Termites are surprisingly common in Brisbane homes.</p></div>\n<p class=\"p1\">With white ants, termites or even damp, you can&#8217;t physically see it from the outside. Building and pest inspectors (who in Queensland are generally licensed builders) will inspect under the house, in the roof and use their own technical equipment to check for damp and other issues.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I&#8217;m not kidding when I say these reports have saved me over five times.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In one year I literally spent over $2000 on reports for different properties before finding the right place but I&#8217;m glad I did! One of the properties had concrete cancer, another had issues with flooding and water leaking through the walls which was going to cost the new owner $9000 to fix, another had termites in a tree in the backyard and evidence of old damage in the roof. This was all stuff I wouldn&#8217;t have found out without using a building and pest inspector.</p>\n<p>Building and pest reports might have cost me a bit, but have saved me much, much more over the years.</p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><strong>A further word of warning.</strong></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">One thing you need to be wary of is when the real estate agent selling the property is pushing their own building and pest inspector.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">You want to maintain your independence and get your own team to look after this. Make sure you use a certified building and pest inspector, and if there are a few small issues in the report that are fixable, that&#8217;s great, you can use this to negotiate discounts from the vendor!</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"hub_pr_n_arrows\"><i class=\"fa fa-angle-left\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i></div>\n<div class=\"hub_previous\">Previous</div>\n<div class=\"hub_previous_link\"><a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/hub/do-your-research/\">Do your research</a></div>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"hub_pr_n_arrows\"><i class=\"fa fa-angle-right\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i></div>\n<div class=\"hub_next\">Next</div>\n<div class=\"hub_next_link\"><a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/hub/do-your-research/be-flood-aware/\">Be flood aware</a></div>\n<p><link rel='stylesheet' href='https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/OwlCarousel2/2.1.3/assets/owl.carousel.min.css'><script src='https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/OwlCarousel2/2.1.3/owl.carousel.min.js'></script><script src='https://use.fontawesome.com/826a7e3dce.js'></script></p>\n<style>.carousel-wrap { margin: 90px auto; padding: 0 5%; width: 80%; position: relative;}/* fix blank or flashing items on carousel */.owl-carousel .item { position: relative; z-index: 100;  -webkit-backface-visibility: hidden; }/* end fix */.owl-nav > div { margin-top: -26px; position: absolute; top: 50%; color: #cdcbcd;}.owl-nav i { font-size: 52px;}.owl-nav .owl-prev { left: -30px;}.owl-nav .owl-next { right: -30px;}</style>\n<p><script>jQuery('.owl-carousel').owlCarousel({ loop: true, margin: 10, nav: true, navText:  --> \"<i class='fa fa-caret-left'></i>\", \"<i class='fa fa-caret-right'></i>\" ], autoplay: false, autoplayHoverPause: false, responsive: { 0: { items: 1 }, 600: { items: 3 }, 1000: { items: 3 } }})</script></p>"

Their main purpose is to sell the property and they will try their best to do so by only sharing a part of the whole truth. Gather information from various sources and don’t just rely on the agent. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">☑️Doing the wrong comparison—People normally don’t consider the size, location, quality of property when comparing properties, which makes it difficult to value a property accurately. As discussed, make correct comparisons by keeping all the factors in mind.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">☑️Making emotional decisions—This is a big NO! Don’t get emotionally attached to the property you want to purchase as you might end up paying a price much higher than the market value.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">☑️Listening to the media—The information provided by the media is not reliable. Its main focus is to sell the news. Instead of seeking information through media channels, visit platforms such as CoreLogic or Residex as they provide real-time information based on actual statistics and facts.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Keeping all these points in mind will help you value a property more accurately and put you in a better position to make a well-informed decision.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><b>Determine the Property’s Value </b></h2>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">As with rental, working out your future home’s value is not an exact science. Ultimately the property is going to be worth the highest amount someone is willing to pay, but you can at least get an indication using the same techniques real estate agents use to price properties.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">To determine a home’s value, you need to look at recent sales of similar properties with these characteristics: </span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">1. <span class=\"s1\">The sales <b>within 2 km of home</b>, in the same suburb </span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">2. <span class=\"s1\">The<b> same property type</b> (unit/house/townhouse/land) </span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">3. <span class=\"s1\">The<b> same number of bedrooms, bathrooms and car parks </b></span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">4. <span class=\"s1\">The <b>same, or similar land size </b></span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">5. <span class=\"s1\">The sale occurred <b>within the last six months </b></span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">6. <span class=\"s1\">Property is in <b>similar condition</b>/has a similar level of improvements (i.e. both have a pool, renovated kitchen, etc.) </span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The last point is where your research can get a bit subjective but try to take a step back and look at it as an external investor would.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\"><b>Method #1: </b></span><b>Confirm the Property’s Value with a Free RP Data Valuation (easiest and best method)</b></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">1. <span class=\"s1\">Go to <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/contact/\"><span class=\"s3\">our Contact Page</span></a>, input your details and in the message include the </span>property address.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">2. <span class=\"s1\">We’ll complete a free RP Data electronic valuation for you <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/82_CHARLOTTE_STREET_PADDINGTON_QLD_4064_11-09-2018__06-04.pdf\"><span class=\"s3\">(sample here)</span></a>, which will do all the work for you</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">3. <span class=\"s1\">The report includes location highlights, recent sales and properties on the market.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">4. <span class=\"s1\">Most importantly it includes an estimated value and estimated price range.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_8299\" style=\"width: 710px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-8299\" class=\"wp-image-8299 size-full\" src=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/rp-data-valuation-free.jpg\" alt=\"rp data valuation free\" width=\"700\" height=\"457\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-8299\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">At Hunter Galloway Mortgage Brokers we can give you access to Free RP Data Reports, just send us the address.</p></div>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Method #2: Researching property values using SoldPrice (best DIY method)</b></span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">1. <span class=\"s1\"><b>Go to </b><a href=\"http://house.ksou.cn/p.php?q=Paddington%252C+QLD\"><span class=\"s3\"><b>SoldPrice</b></span></a><b> website, click ‘Home Sold Price’. </b></span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">2. <span class=\"s1\">Enter your suburb. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">3. <span class=\"s1\">Set Search filters criteria, in our case a minimum three bedroom, minimum of 300 sqm land and property type as a house.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">4. <span class=\"s1\">Review and shortlist results.

Unfortunately, it’s one of the most confusing steps too.</p>\n<p> <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/t3y7__Idl34?feature=oembed&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;rel=0&amp;color=WHITE\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe><br /> </p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To start with:</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>How do you actually work out what a property is worth?</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Or even more important:</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>How do you make sure you are getting the BEST deal on this house?</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">If you’ve ever asked yourself these questions, this chapter has you covered.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">You could save 8-10% off the advertised price</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">When buying a house there is no hard and fast way of determining the value of a property.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The price is what the market is willing to pay.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Therefore all properties that are being sold on the market do not have a hard and fast set price like you would have when going to the supermarket to buy a loaf of bread.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_10106\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-10106\" class=\"wp-image-10106 size-large\" src=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Value-accurately-1-1024x768.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-10106\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">So the first step in negotiating a house price is recognising that the advertised price is NOT the final sale price.</p></div>\n<p class=\"p1\">This is where a term called vendor discounting comes in – this is is the discount between the originally advertised price and the final sale price.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And in Brisbane, it’s common for the final sale price to be 8-10% BELOW the originally advertised price.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In other words, and as an example the figures show a home in Milton being advertised for sale at $1,000,000 is on average discounted by 9.80% – almost 10%…</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And will most likely sell closer to $902,000!</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">So just realise that the price your future home is being advertised for isn’t necessarily the price you will need to pay!</p>\n<table class=\"t1\" width=\"596.2\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"td1\" valign=\"middle\">\n<p

So for 82 Charlotte Street, you might get $675 per week rent, on an $875,00 value = 4.01% rental yield which is broadly in line with the other <a href=\"http://sqmresearch.com.au/property-rental-yield.php?postcode=4064&amp;t=1\"><span class=\"s3\">rental yields in Paddington</span></a> for three-bedroom houses.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Supply and demand in balance</b>—If there is too much supply and not enough demand prices tend to soften.

Longer days on market means it is harder to sell the property because it is taking longer. As you can see from <a href=\"http://sqmresearch.com.au/graph.php?postcode=4064&amp;mode=1&amp;t=1\"><span class=\"s3\">Paddington the days on market has been relatively stable</span></a> since 2000 sitting around 32 days compared to broader Queensland which takes 37 days. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Stable weekly asking property prices</b>—Weekly asking price is another indicator of market health and shows the trend of asking prices in your local market. <a href=\"http://sqmresearch.com.au/asking-property-prices.php?postcode=4064&amp;t=1\"><span class=\"s3\">In Paddington</span></a>, you can see this has remained broadly stable; as it uses median house prices it is difficult for this to be a completely accurate indicator as Paddington often has property sales over $3M which can cause the numbers to be thrown out. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Supply and demand in balance</b>—As we covered above, if there is too much supply and not enough demand prices tend to soften. The <a href=\"http://sqmresearch.com.au/total-property-listings.php?postcode=4064&amp;t=1\"><span class=\"s3\">number of houses for sale in Paddington</span></a> has remained fairly stable since 2012, compared to the number of units which has increased.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Demand to Supply Ratio Score</b>—<a href=\"http://dsrdata.com.au/\"><span class=\"s3\">DSR</span></a> uses a few more data points to estimate the demand to supply ratio, a simple predictor of capital growth potential. The DSR Score in Paddington is 56/100 (anything over 50 is good) and as it explains,<i> ‘This is a healthy market for investors wanting to apply some value-adding strategy. Buyers are sometimes able to get away with low ball offers. Expect growth to marginally exceed the national average.’ </i></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Overall, the property market in Paddington looks good, and with a limited supply of new homes being built, you would expect the property market to remain strong over the next few years.</span></p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_8291\" style=\"width: 623px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-8291\" class=\"wp-image-8291 size-full\" src=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/sqm-research-property-housing-e1536637619991.png\" alt=\"sqm research property housing\" width=\"613\" height=\"185\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-8291\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">SQM Research provides a weekly update on housing stock across all postcodes in Brisbane.</p></div></p>\n<div class=\"hub_pr_n_arrows\"><i class=\"fa fa-angle-left\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i></div>\n<div class=\"hub_previous\">Previous</div>\n<div class=\"hub_previous_link\"><a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/hub/value-accurately/observe-the-market/\">Observe the market</a></div>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"hub_pr_n_arrows\"><i class=\"fa fa-angle-right\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i></div>\n<div class=\"hub_next\">Next</div>\n<div class=\"hub_next_link\"><a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/hub/value-accurately/research-rental-income-per-week/\">Research Rental Income Per Week</a></div>\n<p><link rel='stylesheet' href='https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/OwlCarousel2/2.1.3/assets/owl.carousel.min.css'><script src='https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/OwlCarousel2/2.1.3/owl.carousel.min.js'></script><script src='https://use.fontawesome.com/826a7e3dce.js'></script></p>\n<style>.carousel-wrap { margin: 90px auto; padding: 0 5%; width: 80%; position: relative;}/* fix blank or flashing items on carousel */.owl-carousel .item { position: relative; z-index: 100;  -webkit-backface-visibility: hidden; }/* end fix */.owl-nav > div { margin-top: -26px; position: absolute; top: 50%; color: #cdcbcd;}.owl-nav i { font-size: 52px;}.owl-nav .owl-prev { left: -30px;}.owl-nav .owl-next { right: -30px;}</style>\n<p><script>jQuery('.owl-carousel').owlCarousel({ loop: true, margin: 10, nav: true, navText:  --> \"<i class='fa fa-caret-left'></i>\", \"<i class='fa fa-caret-right'></i>\" ], autoplay: false, autoplayHoverPause: false, responsive: { 0: { items: 1 }, 600: { items: 3 }, 1000: { items: 3 } }})</script></p>"

Just open go online and you’ll find dozens, if not hundreds of options to choose from. Just pick one from the list, make an offer, and boom! You’re done. But making sure that it’s the right one? That’s another story.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Technology has given us more options than ever for property searching. In the past you would have to scan the local paper or visit a real estate agent to see what’s available. Your choices would be limited by which paper you were looking at, or which real estate agents you chose to visit. Today, all it takes is a quick online search and you can find properties for sale all over the country, or even all over the world. We’re really spoilt for choice. That’s both a blessing and a curse. It’s a blessing because you’re not limited to choosing from a small number of available options. But it’s a curse for the very same reason. The vast number of available properties can be overwhelming. You can’t go out and inspect them all.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lHoC7iYI5sw?feature=oembed&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;rel=0&amp;color=WHITE\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Even if you could, you wouldn’t want to. No one in their right mind would want to spend hundreds of hours going to inspections for homes that don’t fit your needs. So what do you do? Pick a few at random and hope for the best? What if you end up settling for a house that’s just “OK”, when your dream home was available just a couple of streets over? You’re going to be in this home for a few years at least. The last thing you want to do is end up with a home that reminds you of your bad choices every time you walk through the door.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Luckily, there is a better way. After helping hundreds of customers on their property search, we have identified a simple method for finding your first home. Using this method, you will maximise your chances of finding a home that is perfect for you.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_8073\" style=\"width: 949px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-8073\" class=\"wp-image-8073 size-full\" src=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/real-estate-alerts.png\" alt=\"real-estate-alerts\" width=\"939\" height=\"460\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-8073\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Alerts can be activated by saving searches on RealEstate.com.au</p></div>\n<p class=\"p1\">Instead of wasting every night on research and every weekend on inspections, you will use a few simple tricks to filter out the time-wasters and only spend your time on the properties that really matter. Instead of relying on gut instinct, you will come to property inspections with a list of key criteria that will help you to decide whether this home is really the right one for you. Instead of taking property prices at face value, you will learn how to independently check whether the asking price is in the right ballpark, way overpriced, or even underpriced—a diamond in the rough.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">You can save yourself a lot of time and frustration if you approach your property search with the right method.</p>\n<div class=\"mceTemp\"> </div>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"hub_pr_n_arrows\"><i class=\"fa fa-angle-left\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i></div>\n<div class=\"hub_previous\">Previous</div>\n<div class=\"hub_previous_link\"><a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/hub/set-up-your-search-for-success/dont-limit-your-search/\">Don’t limit your search</a></div>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"hub_pr_n_arrows\"><i class=\"fa fa-angle-right\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i></div>\n<div class=\"hub_next\">Next</div>\n<div class=\"hub_next_link\"><a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/hub/value-accurately/\">Value Accurately</a></div>\n<p><link rel='stylesheet' href='https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/OwlCarousel2/2.1.3/assets/owl.carousel.min.css'><script src='https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/OwlCarousel2/2.1.3/owl.carousel.min.js'></script><script src='https://use.fontawesome.com/826a7e3dce.js'></script></p>\n<style>.carousel-wrap { margin: 90px auto; padding: 0 5%; width: 80%; position: relative;}/* fix blank or flashing items on carousel */.owl-carousel .item { position: relative; z-index: 100;  -webkit-backface-visibility: hidden; }/* end fix */.owl-nav > div { margin-top: -26px; position: absolute; top: 50%; color: #cdcbcd;}.owl-nav i { font-size: 52px;}.owl-nav .owl-prev { left: -30px;}.owl-nav .owl-next { right: -30px;}</style>\n<p><script>jQuery('.owl-carousel').owlCarousel({ loop: true, margin: 10, nav: true, navText:  --> \"<i class='fa fa-caret-left'></i>\", \"<i class='fa fa-caret-right'></i>\" ], autoplay: false, autoplayHoverPause: false, responsive: { 0: { items: 1 }, 600: { items: 3 }, 1000: { items: 3 } }})</script></p>"

Typically our customers want to buy in the same area they live in now, or have lived in before. It makes a lot of sense—you know the area so it makes you feel a lot more comfortable living there.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">But if you limit yourself just to those areas that you are familiar with, you’re severely limiting your choices.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Don’t be afraid to buy somewhere unfamiliar to get what you want. We all know that real estate is about “location, location, location”, but moving a bit further out can give you way more bang for your buck. There are some great buying opportunities in the outer suburbs.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">There’s no denying it: <b>Brisbane’s market is heating up. </b>That means if you’re looking to buy, it will help if you’re flexible (and realistic).</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Where to Start in Brisbane? </b></span></h2>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">We researched a good mix of some of Brisbane’s most popular suburbs and a few little-known ones based on the following goals.</span></p>\n<p> <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VplzHgGFMcw?feature=oembed&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;rel=0&amp;color=WHITE\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<h2 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\"><b>I want a suburb that’s walkable </b></span></h2>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">If you want walkable, look no further than the city and surrounds, with Fortitude Valley being a trendsetter’s delight.

Young professionals love the area for its proximity to the city and cool sensibility, but a new wave of empty-nesters are selling their family homes and moving here to enjoy the low-maintenance lifestyle offered by New Farm’s apartments and converted lofts in Teneriffe. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><b style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Have a look at New Farm and Teneriffe.</b></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_8222\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-8222\" class=\"wp-image-8222 size-full\" src=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/family-homes.jpg\" alt=\"family homes morningside\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-8222\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Looking for Family Friendly suburbs in Brisbane is easier than the other major cities across Australia.</p></div>\n<h2 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\"><b>I’m looking for something family friendly </b></span></h2>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">With mainly established couples and families, Cannon Hill is like a country town just outside the city. A lovely, friendly community vibe pervades the air here, and it’s close to the CBD, airport, shops, schools and lovely bush walks. Convenience and a peaceful vibe make Cannon Hill popular with commuters. Recent construction at the East Village and the newly renovated Carindale Shopping Centre have only added benefit for local residents. Another area close to the city with great transport and motorway links, Morningside is only five kilometres from Brisbane and within easy access to shopping in the CBD, New Farm, Carindale and Woolloongabba. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> <b>Have a look at Morningside and Cannon Hill.</b></span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_8217\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-8217\" class=\"wp-image-8217 size-full\" src=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Brisbane-property-market.jpg\" alt=\"Brisbane-property-market\" width=\"250\" height=\"334\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-8217\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">There are lots of leafy suburbs like Morningside and Cannon Hill just across the bridge.</p></div>\n<h2 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\"><b>I’d love to be on the water </b></span></h2>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Far enough from the city to feel like another town but close enough to commute every day, these bayside suburbs are tucked away from the hustle and bustle of Brisbane CBD and are mostly populated by mature couples, families and retirees. Manly’s north-east facing aspect, village shopping centre, parkside esplanade and boat harbour provide the perfect setting for enjoying the good life near the water. It’s a clean and friendly village with most conveniences available and good local schools and childcare centres. Homes are a variety of old and new, with many ‘Queenslanders’ in good condition or ripe for renovation.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Have a look at Birkdale, Manly, Wynnum and Lota.</b></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\"><b>We want some room to move </b></span></h2>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Only 12.5 km from the city, Aspley is a well-established suburb with good access to local shops such as the Hypermarket and Chermside Shopping Centre, as well as decent schools, transport and medical facilities. Mostly populated by older couples and mature families, it’s a residential suburb with some professionals who commute to the city. Bracken Ridge has changed a lot in the past decade, with many shops and homes being renovated and a wider variety of people moving in. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Have a look at Aspley, Albany Creek, Bracken Ridge and Chermside.</b></span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_8224\" style=\"width: 584px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-8224\" class=\"wp-image-8224 size-full\" src=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/brisbane-housing.jpg\" alt=\"brisbane housing\" width=\"574\" height=\"380\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-8224\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Need room to move?

Only five kilometres from the city, its mix of colonial homes and apartments makes it a magnet for professionals and families, and the air rings with the industrious sound of renovation. Multicultural and safe, it has a neighbourly atmosphere and offers lifestyle and convenience with suburban charm. A central hub for transport and shopping, the suburb offers both buses and trains in and out of the CBD, easy access to the M3 and is within close proximity to Woolworths. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Have a look at Annerley, Buranda and Moorooka as well as Fairfield Gardens and Stones Corner.</b></span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_8218\" style=\"width: 970px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-8218\" class=\"wp-image-8218 size-full\" src=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/home-loans-in-qld.jpg\" alt=\"home loans in qld\" width=\"960\" height=\"600\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-8218\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Annerley and Buranda are a short drive across the Story Bridge to Brisbane&#8217;s city.</p></div>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> <i>‘Depending on what type of home you are looking for the suburb has the biggest impact.

And so it should be. If we were all robots, we’d all be living in identical cubes that offer us shelter, a bed, and a place to eat and not much else. Emotion is an important part of buying a home because you want to live somewhere that makes you feel good. But if you get too emotional, you can end up making costly mistakes.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">There are two common emotional situations that you want to avoid: rushing to buy and buying out of frustration.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Let’s talk about feeling rushed and why it sucks. I know this one well because I’ve been that guy.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When my (now) wife and I moved back to Brisbane from Sydney we were desperate to buy.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I had spent a few months looking for properties to buy in Brisbane before we moved up, but once we had boots on the ground up here I felt like there was a gun to my head to buy because the alternative was living with my in-laws. I would have bought a tin shed behind a rubbish tip if it had been for sale; I was at panic stations.</span></p>\n<p><iframe width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rmDx57-gOsI?feature=oembed&#038;modestbranding=1&#038;showinfo=0&#038;rel=0&#038;color=WHITE\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>This situation is super common and we see people like this every day.</b></span></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I wasn’t thinking clearly and just barely avoided buying a house that was riddled with problems—ones that I would have seen miles away if I’d done my research properly. Luckily the deal didn’t go through. Even so, I’d wasted 3 weeks on this property and ended up back where I started, but with even <i>less</i> time to find the right home. Luckily I came to my senses, took a step back, and worked through the process that I’m going to show you later in this chapter.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Buying out of frustration can cause the same problems but for different reasons. When you’ve been looking for a few months and missed out on a few properties, it starts to feel like you’ll never get a home that feels right for you. You get more and more fed up with the whole process, and it’s tempting to just get it over with and buy the next place that seems “good enough”.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If you find yourself in this situation try to take a breather and get some perspective.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">You are about to spend $300,000 or $400,000 or maybe even more—how many years would it take you to earn this much money? Then why rush into buying something that you might not be entirely happy with?</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As we covered above property in </span><span class=\"s2\">Australia isn’t cheap</span><span class=\"s1\">, and rushing into the front property could be something you live to regret for a long time.</span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-10097 size-large\" src=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Keep-emotion-out-of-it-1-1024x768.png\" alt=\"Keep emotion out of it  \" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Rather than rushing into something and buying out of pure frustration, try taking a few weeks off.

Will it need a new kitchen and bathroom in the short term? </span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b><strong>✅</strong>If you bought the property, who would buy it from you in a few years?</b></span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">I like to start with the end in mind; when buying a property I always think about who I will sell it to in a few years. If it’s going to be a very narrow market like retirees, is this going to harm the growth potential of the property?</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><iframe width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KXVu9Lp0ogU?feature=oembed&#038;modestbranding=1&#038;showinfo=0&#038;rel=0&#038;color=WHITE\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p>\n<h2 class=\"p3\"><b>Warning: Not All Properties are Okay with the Banks </b></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Did you know that if a lender isn’t satisfied with the property condition, they may not approve your loan? This is why it is important not to buy a property <b><i>before</i></b> you apply for your loan. Keep the following tips in mind as a general rule when finding the right property for which a lender will approve your loan: </span></p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>✅</strong>The unit should be at least 50 m² excluding the parking garage and balconies </span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>✅</strong>Some lenders don’t approve a property if land area is more than 2 hectares, but it varies from one bank to another. There are some lenders who also accept a property as a security even if the area is 50 hectares or higher. </span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>✅</strong>Some banks reduce the loan-to-value ratio if the property is located in a remote area.</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>✅</strong>Banks may value the property way less than its purchase price if the seller has included furniture in the purchase price, and offers a settlement rebate and rental guarantee. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">All in all, the property has to be in good condition if you want the bank’s approval. In addition to that, make sure that when finding the right property, you get the building and pest inspection done and get a strata report, especially if you’re buying townhouses or units. </span></p>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"hub_pr_n_arrows\"><i class=\"fa fa-angle-left\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i></div>\n<div class=\"hub_previous\">Previous</div>\n<div class=\"hub_previous_link\"><a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/hub/set-up-your-search-for-success/\">Set up your search for success</a></div>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"hub_pr_n_arrows\"><i class=\"fa fa-angle-right\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i></div>\n<div class=\"hub_next\">Next</div>\n<div class=\"hub_next_link\"><a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/hub/set-up-your-search-for-success/keep-emotion-out-of-it/\">Keep emotion out of it</a></div>\n<p><link rel='stylesheet' href='https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/OwlCarousel2/2.1.3/assets/owl.carousel.min.css'><script src='https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/OwlCarousel2/2.1.3/owl.carousel.min.js'></script><script src='https://use.fontawesome.com/826a7e3dce.js'></script></p>\n<style>.carousel-wrap { margin: 90px auto; padding: 0 5%; width: 80%; position: relative;}/* fix blank or flashing items on carousel */.owl-carousel .item { position: relative; z-index: 100;  -webkit-backface-visibility: hidden; }/* end fix */.owl-nav > div { margin-top: -26px; position: absolute; top: 50%; color: #cdcbcd;}.owl-nav i { font-size: 52px;}.owl-nav .owl-prev { left: -30px;}.owl-nav .owl-next { right: -30px;}</style>\n<p><script>jQuery('.owl-carousel').owlCarousel({ loop: true, margin: 10, nav: true, navText:  --> \"<i class='fa fa-caret-left'></i>\", \"<i class='fa fa-caret-right'></i>\" ], autoplay: false, autoplayHoverPause: false, responsive: { 0: { items: 1 }, 600: { items: 3 }, 1000: { items: 3 } }})</script></p>"

Being declined by one lender doesn’t mean they will all decline you.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If you’re working with a mortgage broker, they will usually reach out to you to discuss your other options if your loan has been declined. </span></p>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"hub_pr_n_arrows\"><i class=\"fa fa-angle-left\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i></div>\n<div class=\"hub_previous\">Previous</div>\n<div class=\"hub_previous_link\"><a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/hub/get-the-right-home-loan/preapproval/\">Why you should get a pre approval</a></div>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"hub_pr_n_arrows\"><i class=\"fa fa-angle-right\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i></div>\n<div class=\"hub_next\">Next</div>\n<div class=\"hub_next_link\"><a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/hub/get-the-right-home-loan/questions/\">Questions to ask your mortgage broker</a></div>\n<p><link rel='stylesheet' href='https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/OwlCarousel2/2.1.3/assets/owl.carousel.min.css'><script src='https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/OwlCarousel2/2.1.3/owl.carousel.min.js'></script><script src='https://use.fontawesome.com/826a7e3dce.js'></script></p>\n<style>.carousel-wrap { margin: 90px auto; padding: 0 5%; width: 80%; position: relative;}/* fix blank or flashing items on carousel */.owl-carousel .item { position: relative; z-index: 100;  -webkit-backface-visibility: hidden; }/* end fix */.owl-nav > div { margin-top: -26px; position: absolute; top: 50%; color: #cdcbcd;}.owl-nav i { font-size: 52px;}.owl-nav .owl-prev { left: -30px;}.owl-nav .owl-next { right: -30px;}</style>\n<p><script>jQuery('.owl-carousel').owlCarousel({ loop: true, margin: 10, nav: true, navText:  --> \"<i class='fa fa-caret-left'></i>\", \"<i class='fa fa-caret-right'></i>\" ], autoplay: false, autoplayHoverPause: false, responsive: { 0: { items: 1 }, 600: { items: 3 }, 1000: { items: 3 } }})</script></p>"

Home loans will no longer be a mysterious black box of confusing terms, with hidden fees and other tricks that will cause you to pay more money than you really have to. You’ll be able to have an informed discussion with your bank or mortgage broker and know exactly what type of loan is right for you.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I’d recommend reading this section even if you find home loans about as exciting as watching paint dry—when you have 20+ years of home loan repayments ahead of you, it pays to know what you’re getting into!</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">That being said, one of the best things you can do (even if you love finance) is to talk to a mortgage broker when you’re looking at your options.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I’m sure you’re probably thinking something like “Of course you’d say that, you’re a mortgage broker”, but if you’ll forgive me the shameless plug I’ll explain to you <b>why</b> you should use a mortgage broker—even if it’s not me.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Compared to a bank, mortgage brokers can offer you a choice from hundreds of different loans from dozens of loan providers. They are always up to date with the latest deals and best rates, and through experience with lots of different loan scenarios we know how to maximise the chances of your loan being approved.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Going directly to a bank is fine if you know exactly what you’re looking for. In other words, you have done the research and found a loan that you think is the best option for you. But there’s always a chance that you’ve missed something, and that can be a costly mistake.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Mortgage brokers are independent. Our business relies on delighting our customers by finding them the best loan, not by choosing from a limited selection of loans that are really designed to rope you into the bank’s whole financial system.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">You might also be wondering why we’re talking about finance before we’ve even started looking for a home. Surely it makes more sense to find a home you want, and then get a loan for whatever amount you need to buy that dream home, right?</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This is where many first home buyers get it wrong. If you dive in to your property hunt without getting a preapproval, you’re setting yourself up for unnecessary stress and disappointment. Things can move quickly in the real estate world, and if you’re unprepared you will find yourself scrambling to secure finance in the middle of everything else, which is complicated enough as it is!</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">You’re much better off front-loading the effort on this and talking to a broker <i>before</i> you start looking for a home. Not only will you save yourself some stress, you’ll be coming to the table with a much more realistic understanding of what you can afford. You will also be able to get one up on your competition—offers that are made with finance already secured are much more attractive to real estate agents, because they have a much higher chance of going through.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Now that we’ve covered that, let’s dive in and look at the details of home loans. This will help you to have an informed conversation with your mortgage broker and make sure that you get a loan that suits your specific needs.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"></span></p>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"hub_pr_n_arrows\"><i class=\"fa fa-angle-left\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i></div>\n<div class=\"hub_previous\">Previous</div>\n<div class=\"hub_previous_link\"><a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/hub/know-your-budget/\">Know Your Budget</a></div>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"hub_pr_n_arrows\"><i class=\"fa fa-angle-right\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i></div>\n<div class=\"hub_next\">Next</div>\n<div class=\"hub_next_link\"><a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/hub/know-your-budget/finance-basics/\n\">Understand LVR, LMI and Genuine Savings</a></div>\n<p><link rel='stylesheet' href='https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/OwlCarousel2/2.1.3/assets/owl.carousel.min.css'><script src='https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/OwlCarousel2/2.1.3/owl.carousel.min.js'></script><script src='https://use.fontawesome.com/826a7e3dce.js'></script></p>\n<style>.carousel-wrap { margin: 90px auto;

The mortgage broker will set up a meeting and assess your current financial situation to find out if you meet the eligibility criteria. They will also discuss your objectives and requirements to find out the best solution for you.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">You are required to provide the following list of documents during the application process:</span></p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>✅ </strong>Identity documents, passport and driver’s license</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>✅ </strong>Payslips, group certificates</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>✅ </strong>Bank account statement</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>✅ </strong>Expenses and liabilities account</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>✅ </strong>Documents containing asset details, and</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>✅ </strong>Contract of sale</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>The bank will ask to check your pay account and look for salary credits and loan repayments.</i></span></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zya9xA-2nmA?feature=oembed&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;rel=0&amp;color=WHITE\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<h2 class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s3\"><b>N</b><a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/pre-approval/\"><span class=\"s4\"><b>ot all pre-approvals are created equal.</b></span></a></span></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In most cases a <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/pre-approval/\"><span class=\"s4\">pre-approval</span></a> is just an indication that the bank is okay to consider approving your loan; the bank may just complete a credit check and not check any of your documents and wait until you lodge a full mortgage application to do this.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">With some banks, a full mortgage application is only done when you have signed the contract on a purchase property—which is not possible when going to auction. Lenders like this will only verify your payslips, bank statements and income information when they receive this contract of sale, putting you at risk when going to auction because you can’t be 100% sure they can lend you the money.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>At Hunter Galloway we work with several lenders who fully verify your documents before issuing a </b><a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/pre-approval/\"><span class=\"s4\"><b>pre-approval</b></span></a><b>; this makes a much more reliable approval with fewer conditions when you are buying at auction.</b></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>What Are Some Common Pre-Approval Conditions?</b></span></h2>\n<p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s1\">In most cases, a <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/pre-approval/\"><span class=\"s4\">pre-approval</span></a> has conditions that need to be completed before the loan can be unconditionally approved. This is quite common and these range from generic conditions like subject to a bank valuation to specific conditions like getting a letter from your employer confirming your start date. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>A few common </b><a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/pre-approval/\"><span class=\"s4\"><b>pre-approval</b></span></a><b> conditions include:</b></span></p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>✅ </strong>Our validation of all details provided to ensure they are true and correct</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>✅ </strong>Our receipt of all necessary supporting documentation</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>✅ </strong>Satisfactory valuation for the proposed security property(s)</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>✅ </strong>Lenders mortgage insurance approval, if required</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>✅ </strong>No significant change in the customer’s financial position</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Aside from understanding you have a reliable pre-approval, it’s important to know what your auction budget should be, what the repayments are going to look like after you’ve bought the property and how much deposit you need.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>What to Do Once the Application Is Submitted for a Pre-Approval</b></span></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Make sure the loan application is in line with the bank’s policy before you submit it. You can seek the advice of a lender or a mortgage broker to make sure it adheres to the policy and ask the following questions:</span></p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Can I make a bid at the <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/buying-at-auction/\"><span class=\"s4\">auction</span></a>?</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Am I required to satisfy conditions before going to the <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/buying-at-auction/\"><span class=\"s4\">auction</span></a> or making an offer?</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">What are the pre-approval conditions?</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Has my application been approved by the lenders mortgage insurer?</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Has my application been accepted by the credit department?</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p2\"><i style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Important reminder: Lending policies and interest rates vary from time to time and are subject to change. So, when you go to an </i><a style=\"font-size: 18px;\" href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/buying-at-auction/\"><span class=\"s4\"><i>auction</i></span></a><i style=\"font-size: 18px;\">, make sure you are aware of the policies and current rates.</i></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-9408\" src=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Pre-approval-process-e1548033257623.png\" alt=\"Pre approval process\" width=\"800\" height=\"1780\" /></p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Are Pre-Approvals Always Reliable?</b></span></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">First of all, avoid non-written applications or a non-formal application; this includes an application that is submitted over the phone or a quick online application. It is likely that these applications have fewer guarantees and you might end up fulfilling different conditions related to your application at a later date, which will only increase your work.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">You are required to submit a formal approval signed by a lender for it to be reliable. This will make it easier for a lender to assess your application. The more conditions you fulfil, the higher your chances are to get a pre-approval.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Make sure the following things are done to be able to secure a home loan pre-approval:</span></p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>✅</strong>The lender accepts your loan application after evaluating your financial situation.</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>✅</strong>Banks or lenders don’t have to check off too many conditions on the application. If there are things on the application that are yet to be confirmed, ask the bank to confirm it first and then submit your application for approval.</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>✅</strong>The pre-approval submitted is for more than what you plan to spend on the property. This way you won’t have to apply for another pre-approval if the budget is revised.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Is There Any Difference Between a Pre-Approval and Conditional Approval?</b></span></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Pre-approval is not a complete approval in principle. Once the lender receives your application and supporting documents, they’ll evaluate it to confirm if it is in line with their policy. The approval of an application depends on certain conditions; for example, a bank might accept a property as security against the loan.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A mortgage broker can also help you get a pre-approval on your loan if you haven’t finalised any property yet. It’s only valid for 90 days, but you can get an extension by providing certain documents like salary slip, etc.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In some cases, applicants purchase a property before getting a pre-approval. They sign the agreement of purchase and then apply for a loan. But it’s a risky move as you may end up losing your initial deposit paid to buy a property if you are unable to get a loan.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>What Is the Difference Between Final Approval (Sometimes Called Unconditional Approval) and Conditional Approval?</b></span></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Once you fulfil all the conditions, the bank will give you unconditional or final approval. This is the final step in securing a loan. It shows that you are guaranteed to receive a loan and your application has been fully approved. Unconditional approval is only reversed if a lender suspects any fraudulent activity or finds any discrepancy that was missed earlier.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If a private vendor accepts your offer or you win in an <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/buying-at-auction/\"><span class=\"s4\">auction</span></a>, you’ll get a grace period of one to three weeks to get your initial deposit and finances in order. During that period, you can check back with your lender to make sure they will honour the contract. Even if you don’t get a grace period, make an inquiry and ask your lender if they will give you approval.</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"hub_pr_n_arrows\"><i class=\"fa fa-angle-left\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i></div>\n<div class=\"hub_previous\">Previous</div>\n<div class=\"hub_previous_link\"><a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/hub/get-the-right-home-loan/choice/\">Choose the right home loan</a></div>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"hub_pr_n_arrows\"><i class=\"fa fa-angle-right\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i></div>\n<div class=\"hub_next\">Next</div>\n<div class=\"hub_next_link\"><a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/hub/get-the-right-home-loan/declined/\">Getting your home loan declined isn’t the end of the world</a></div>\n<p><link rel='stylesheet' href='https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/OwlCarousel2/2.1.3/assets/owl.carousel.min.css'><script src='https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/OwlCarousel2/2.1.3/owl.carousel.min.js'></script><script src='https://use.fontawesome.com/826a7e3dce.js'></script></p>\n<style>.carousel-wrap { margin: 90px auto; padding: 0 5%; width: 80%; position: relative;}/* fix blank or flashing items on carousel */.owl-carousel .item { position: relative; z-index: 100;  -webkit-backface-visibility: hidden; }/* end fix */.owl-nav > div { margin-top: -26px; position: absolute; top: 50%; color: #cdcbcd;}.owl-nav i { font-size: 52px;}.owl-nav .owl-prev { left: -30px;}.owl-nav .owl-next { right: -30px;}</style>\n<p><script>jQuery('.owl-carousel').owlCarousel({ loop: true, margin: 10, nav: true, navText:  --> \"<i class='fa fa-caret-left'></i>\", \"<i class='fa fa-caret-right'></i>\" ], autoplay: false, autoplayHoverPause: false, responsive: { 0: { items: 1 }, 600: { items: 3 }, 1000: { items: 3 } }})</script></p>"

They are always up to date with the latest deals and best rates, and through experience with lots of different loan scenarios we know how to maximise the chances of your loan being approved.</p>\n<p>Going directly to a bank is fine if you know exactly what you&#8217;re looking for. In other words, you have done the research and found a loan that you think is the best option for you.

Surely it makes more sense to find a home you want, and then get a loan for whatever amount you need to buy that dream home, right?</p>\n<p>This is where many first home buyers get it wrong. If you dive in to your property hunt without getting a pre-approval, you&#8217;re setting yourself up for unnecessary stress and disappointment. Things can move quickly in the real estate world, and if you&#8217;re unprepared you will find yourself scrambling to secure finance in the middle of everything else, which is complicated enough as it is!</p>\n<p>You&#8217;re much better off front-loading the effort on this and talking to a broker <u>before</u> you start looking for a home. Not only will you save yourself some stress, you&#8217;ll be coming to the table with a much more realistic understanding of what you can afford. You will also be able to get one up on your competition&#8211;offers that are made with finance already secured are much more attractive to real estate agents, because they have a much higher chance of going through.</p>\n<p>Now that we&#8217;ve covered that, let&#8217;s dive in and look at the details of home loans. This will help you to have an informed conversation with your mortgage broker and make sure that you get a loan that suits your specific needs.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2><strong>Choose the right home loan</strong></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Home loans come in all shapes and sizes. There are literally dozens of different home loan types on offer, depending on what you’ll be doing with the home, what other features you need (like offset accounts), and a whole host of other criteria.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Choosing the right home loan is critically important. When you choose the right type of loan, the banks will give you better deals. You will end up with lower repayments, which means more money in your pocket instead of in the banks’. On the other hand, choosing the wrong home loan can cause all kinds of problems. You could get trapped with an expensive loan that doesn’t give you the flexibility you need, with hefty exit fees that make it prohibitively expensive to refinance your loan.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Based on your situation you need to decide on the type of loan and then convert it to bank-speak.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_8137\" style=\"width: 498px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-8137\" class=\"wp-image-8137 size-full\" src=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Buying-a-home-in-Paddington.jpg\" alt=\"Buying a home in Paddington\" width=\"488\" height=\"326\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-8137\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Different homes need different home loans</p></div>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Different loans will also mean different features which we will get to in a minute.</b></span></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">With that, here’s a list of loan types (in bank speak):</span></p>\n<table class=\"t1\" width=\"100%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"td1\" valign=\"middle\">\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>What you’re doing</b></span></p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"td2\" valign=\"middle\">\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Type of loan (in bank speak)</b></span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"td1\" valign=\"middle\">\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Buying a home to live in</b></span></p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"td2\" valign=\"middle\">\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">&gt;&gt; Owner-occupied purchase</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"td3\" valign=\"middle\">\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Buying a property to rent out</b></span></p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"td4\" valign=\"middle\">\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">&gt;&gt; Investment property purchase</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"td1\" valign=\"middle\">\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Looking for a cheaper interest rate</b></span></p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"td2\" valign=\"middle\">\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">&gt;&gt; Refinancing owner-occupied home</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"td3\" valign=\"middle\">\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Building a home</b></span></p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"td4\" valign=\"middle\">\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">&gt;&gt; Construction of owner-occupied property</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"td1\" valign=\"middle\">\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Looking to increase your loan</b></span></p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"td2\" valign=\"middle\">\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">&gt;&gt; Equity release of funds for personal purposes</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Bank speak can be confusing, so don’t worry if you’re not exactly sure which type of loan you need right now.

With a fixed rate home loan, your repayments will stay the same for a fixed period (usually X to Y years). This gives you stability. With a variable home loan, your repayments will change based on current interest rates.

class=\"s1\">Either from your parents, friends or family, you might have heard the old adage: rent money is dead money.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This is simply not true.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">With <a href=\"http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/6416.0\"><span class=\"s2\">median property prices in Melbourne and Sydney</span></a> approaching the $1M mark, and rents at a relatively low point, renting and buying an investment property, instead of a home, could make financial sense.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_10073\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-10073\" class=\"wp-image-10073 size-large\" src=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Rent-Money-isn’t-dead-money-1-1024x768.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-10073\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Renting, and buying an investment property could make financial sense.</p></div>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Let’s say you earn a salary of $70,000 p.a. and you have managed to save $50,000, you are paying $400 pw and rent a place in a desirable location with a median price of, say, $600,000 for a unit in Brisbane, like Hamilton.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">You would currently be paying $20,800 in rent per year, versus interest repayments of $24,300 at 4.50%.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Your mortgage repayments would be closer to $36,000 per year when you look into paying down the principal of the loan.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This isn’t taking into consideration the costs of owning a property which can include council and water rates, insurance, maintenance, strata if you own a unit—which can add another $4 – 5K per year.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">So in effect, it would cost you around $10 – 20K per year extra to own your own home, without any tax offsets or advantages.</span></p>\n<p><iframe

lets you balance lifestyle with smart investing.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In this same situation you could continue to rent and invest the $10 – 20K extra you would be paying elsewhere in property or other assets.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Now financial gain isn’t the only reason people buy property: there are emotional and family reasons which we’ll talk more about shortly.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">But it’s just keeping in mind that it’s important to look at the numbers to understand if rent money is really

But having an opinion doesn’t make them right. The same goes for market commentators on deciding on the right or wrong time to buy.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">There’s always uncertainty. What happens if you decide not to buy a home because you think that prices are going to crash, only to see house prices go up another 10% next year? Or what if you buy at the peak of the market, and you’re left with a house worth 20% on paper than you paid for it?</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4yHBf68LVOg?feature=oembed&#038;modestbranding=1&#038;showinfo=0&#038;rel=0&#038;color=WHITE\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><strong>There are two main problems here: Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO) and Fear of Joining In (FOJI)</strong></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">Everyone knows about FOMO. We get FOMO from all kinds of things, big and small. If you’ve ever had an invite for a party that you weren’t super keen on going to, but you went anyway because you were worried about missing out on the potential for an amazing time, you’ve been ruled by FOMO.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">You need to be aware of FOMO, because it pressures you into doing something that you might not be ready to do. If you let yourself be ruled by FOMO, you might find yourself buying a home that isn’t really right for you, simply because you’re worried that if you wait any longer you’re going to miss out on buying a home entirely. This is simply not the case. <b>There will always be another home for you to buy.</b> Don’t trap yourself in the illusion that you have to buy a home <b>right now</b> because it’s your only chance.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">FOJI is FOMO’s lesser known cousin. The fear of joining in rears its ugly head when we don’t do something, even when all evidence shows us that we should do it, simply because we think we’ve missed something important and we’re going to be punished for our lapse in judgement. If you get stuck in FOJI, you’ll never get anywhere. The amount of information that you would need to evaluate for any decision, including buying your first home, is virtually infinite. If you’re caught in this illusion, you’ll always put off making that big decision, because there’s always something else that you need to know before you feel confident in your choices. We can never know everything, but this shouldn’t stop you from taking action.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-10066\" src=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/buy-at-the-right-time-1-1-300x225.png\" alt=\"buy at the right time \" width=\"363\" height=\"272\" /></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The ideal place to be is somewhere in between FOMO and FOJI. If you can find that balance, you will reap the benefits of both. FOMO in small doses will give you the motivation to take action instead of simply waiting for a better time. And a small amount of FOJI will help you to be more cautious with your decisions—it will give you the motivation to do your research and be thorough with your property search.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In this chapter I’m going to show you how to take an objective look at your situation and decide if it really is the best time for you to buy a house.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"hub_pr_n_arrows\"><i class=\"fa fa-angle-left\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i></div>\n<div class=\"hub_previous\">Previous</div>\n<div class=\"hub_previous_link\"><a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/hub/know-your-budget/cost-of-buying-a-home/\">The true costs of buying a home</a></div>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"hub_pr_n_arrows\"><i class=\"fa fa-angle-right\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i></div>\n<div class=\"hub_next\">Next</div>\n<div class=\"hub_next_link\"><a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/hub/buy-right-time/assess-your-situation/\">Assess your situation</a></div>\n<p><link rel='stylesheet' href='https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/OwlCarousel2/2.1.3/assets/owl.carousel.min.css'><script src='https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/OwlCarousel2/2.1.3/owl.carousel.min.js'></script><script src='https://use.fontawesome.com/826a7e3dce.js'></script></p>\n<style>.carousel-wrap { margin: 90px auto; padding: 0 5%; width: 80%; position: relative;}/* fix blank or flashing items on carousel */.owl-carousel .item { position: relative; z-index: 100;  -webkit-backface-visibility: hidden; }/* end fix */.owl-nav > div { margin-top: -26px; position: absolute; top: 50%; color: #cdcbcd;}.owl-nav i { font-size: 52px;}.owl-nav .owl-prev { left: -30px;}.owl-nav .owl-next { right: -30px;}</style>\n<p><script>jQuery('.owl-carousel').owlCarousel({ loop: true, margin: 10, nav: true, navText:  --> \"<i class='fa fa-caret-left'></i>\", \"<i class='fa fa-caret-right'></i>\" ], autoplay: false, autoplayHoverPause: false, responsive: { 0: { items: 1 }, 600: { items: 3 }, 1000: { items: 3 } }})</script></p>"

Every single person has a unique set of circumstances that drive their decision to buy a home.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It would be impossible to cover everything in this book, so I want to focus on the key points here and give you a few benchmarks to look at. You can measure yourself against these criteria to see whether you’re really ready to buy a home, or if you should sort a few things out before taking that first leap into home ownership.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-8484\" src=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/how-to-buy-a-house.png\" alt=\"how-to-buy-a-house\" width=\"538\" height=\"427\" /></p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><b>Your employment</b></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">As we&#8217;ve mentioned earlier, your employment (and sources of income) is one of the most important factors that banks will be looking at to decide whether to offer you a loan (and how much they will offer). While there are workarounds for almost every situation, here&#8217;s what we recommend:</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>✅</strong></span> You should have been in your job for six months: Banks like borrowers who have stable employment history, ideally at least six to twelve months in your current job. If you have just started a new job, that is ok if you have been in the same industry for at least 2 years.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>✅</strong>You shouldn&#8217;t be planning on changing jobs until your loan has settled: If you are considering changing jobs at the same time as buying a new home you need to seriously reconsider one or the other. The bank would have assessed your income based on your previous job, and if it changes before your move into your new home they will want to reassess your entire loan application (and won’t necessarily say yes again!)</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>✅</strong></span>If you have had a decrease in income: This is fairly common for casual workers whose hours fluctuate week by week. You might have been working more hours earlier in the year, or even received a bonus and now you are being paid less. That’s ok, different banks assess this income differently – some banks will look at your weekly pay and multiple it by 46, other banks will just take your weekly pay and multiple it by 52 weeks in the year. A good mortgage broker will help you navigate this to find the best option for you.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>✅</strong></span> If you are self employed, or a contractor make sure your records are up to date: The banks will ask you for a little bit more information compared to a regular PAYG employee, so you may need to have your tax returns updated and ready to go for your home loan application. Most banks will require the most recent years tax returns before the ATO needs them. For example, while the ATO requires FY19 tax returns lodged by companies and trusts by 15 May 2019, the banks will start asking for this information from 1 January 2019! Better get that accountant crunching your numbers.</p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><b>Your spending</b></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">When you apply for a home loan nearly all banks will want to see your last 3 months (some banks even want to see 4 months!!?) day to day transaction account statements.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">As crazy as it might sound if you spend too much at Zara, Dan Murphy’s or even Sportsbet on the weekend it could affect your home loan application.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This is because the bank will look at your day to day spending habits from the past month, look at these costs and annualise them to determine what it costs you to live each year… And if you had a particularly expensive month, it could reduce how much the bank is willing to lend you!</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Here’s what we recommend with living expenses:</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>✅</strong> Know the bank will see every single transaction you’ve made over the last 3-4 months: I’ve seen banks come back and question a couple who spend money at Baby Bunting asking if they had an ‘undisclosed child’ (they had bought a gift for a friends baby shower)… And I’ve seen other loans declined for spending too much gambling (she had applied straight after Melbourne Cup). As crazy as it sounds, just be aware of this in the months leading up to applying for your home loan – tightening the belt for a few short months could be the difference between getting your home or not.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>✅</strong>Let your Mortgage Broker know about any one off expenses: If you’ve recently gone on holidays, or had any large one-off expenses like aeroplane tickets let your broker know so they can make the bank aware it is a one off expense and won’t be ongoing… And ultimately won’t affect your ability to repay the loan!</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>✅</strong>Prove you can afford the loan, before you get the loan: The banks are increasingly looking for you to prove you have an existing history of keeping up your home loan repayments, even before you get your loan. In other words, they want to see that what you’ve been paying in rental + savings is the same as what your mortgage repayments will be. So if you have been paying $2,000 per month in rental, and saving $500 per month – and your new home loan repayments are $2,000 per month you will be fine. You have proven propensity to repay your loan!</p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><b>Your credit</b></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">Your credit score is another critical factor in your ability to secure a loan at the best rate. If you have bad credit, it will be much harder to get a loan. If you do get approved for a loan, you&#8217;ll end up paying a much higher interest rate because the banks see you as a higher risk. You can check your credit score for free at <a href=\"https://www.equifax.com.au/\">Equifax</a> you get one free report every 12 months! Here&#8217;s what we recommend for credit scores:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-10093 size-large\" src=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/equifax-free-credit-score-1024x371.png\" alt=\"equifax free credit score\" width=\"1024\" height=\"371\" /></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>✅</strong></span> Your Credit Score: A good credit score is between 622 to 725, a very good score is between 726 to 832 and an excellent score falls between 833 to 1200. If your credit score is below this check to see if you have missed any payments, or unpaid defaults on your credit file.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>✅</strong></span> Defaults: You will see default on your credit file if your repayments are more than 60 days late and the amount due was over $150. Check these details are correct and you did receive the notices listed. If you have settled the overdue amount make sure it is showing as ‘paid.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>✅</strong></span> Double check the Loans and Debts: Make sure these are your debts, the amount is correct and that there aren’t any duplicates.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>✅</strong></span> Your personal information: Check your information on the report is correct, like your name, gender, date of birth, current address, drivers licence number and current employer.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">A late phone bill won’t impact you unless you go into default and getting a pay rise or changing jobs won’t negatively impact your credit score…</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">But according to Experian, “A score may go up or down because of new information. For instance, if you already have a very low credit score, a new default may not lower your score any further. Similarly, a default will stay on your credit report for five years even once you pay it off, and should there be other defaults on your file, your score may not necessarily increase. Likewise, if you already have a very high credit score, continuing to make your payments on time may not make your score go any higher. It’s important to note that there is no quick way to fix a credit score – repairing bad credit takes time.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">So make sure you keep paying those bills on time!</p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><b>Your deposit</b></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">If you don&#8217;t have a decent deposit, you will find it harder to get a loan, and you will need to pay LMI in most cases. This adds a significant cost to your loan and is best avoided if you can. Here&#8217;s our recommendations for deposits:</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>✅</strong></span> Have at least 8% to 10% in savings: While there are a handful of lenders who will do up to 95% LVR loans, the LMI costs and stricter credit criteria can make it more difficult to get your loan approved. Having 8% to 10% in savings will give you the maximum amount of options to buy your home.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>✅</strong></span>If you are buying with the help of a guarantor: Make sure you take into consideration all costs. As we’ll cover shortly, buying a home costs more than just the purchase price and some stamp duty. You need funds for solicitor fees, moving costs, transfer duty and a bunch of other costs! Factor in another 0.5-1.00% to cover any incidental costs you might have when buying your home.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>✅</strong></span>If you are just short on your deposit: Try asking your parents, or a relative to gift the deposit amount you are short. I’ve seen cases where $2,000 in extra deposit have saved $4,000 in LMI costs!</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"hub_pr_n_arrows\"><i class=\"fa fa-angle-left\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i></div>\n<div class=\"hub_previous\">Previous</div>\n<div class=\"hub_previous_link\"><a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/hub/buy-right-time/\">Buy at the right time</a></div>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"hub_pr_n_arrows\"><i class=\"fa fa-angle-right\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i></div>\n<div class=\"hub_next\">Next</div>\n<div class=\"hub_next_link\"><a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/hub/buy-right-time/time-in-the-market-vs-timing-the-market/\">Time in the market vs. timing the market</a></div>\n<p><link rel='stylesheet' href='https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/OwlCarousel2/2.1.3/assets/owl.carousel.min.css'><script src='https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/OwlCarousel2/2.1.3/owl.carousel.min.js'></script><script src='https://use.fontawesome.com/826a7e3dce.js'></script></p>\n<style>.carousel-wrap { margin: 90px auto; padding: 0 5%; width: 80%; position: relative;}/* fix blank or flashing items on carousel */.owl-carousel .item { position: relative; z-index: 100;  -webkit-backface-visibility: hidden; }/* end fix */.owl-nav > div { margin-top: -26px; position: absolute; top: 50%; color: #cdcbcd;}.owl-nav i { font-size: 52px;}.owl-nav .owl-prev { left: -30px;}.owl-nav .owl-next { right: -30px;}</style>\n<p><script>jQuery('.owl-carousel').owlCarousel({ loop: true, margin: 10, nav: true, navText:  --> \"<i class='fa fa-caret-left'></i>\", \"<i class='fa fa-caret-right'></i>\" ], autoplay: false, autoplayHoverPause: false, responsive: { 0: { items: 1 }, 600: { items: 3 }, 1000: { items: 3 } }})</script></p>"

In fact, I had less than 5%, so I could only just afford the property and definitely couldn’t afford any expected costs.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">If you’ve been paying attention so far, you know that overextending yourself is a bad idea, and I almost got caught out.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Here are some additional costs that you need to consider when buying your home.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gRPSKfM586I?feature=oembed&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;rel=0&amp;color=WHITE\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><b>Borrowing Costs</b></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">In my case, I got to settlement assuming that the bank was happy to charge my just a fat interest rate and no other fees— but that just wasn’t the case.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>I had to scramble to find an extra $1200 on the settlement to cover my bank and settlement fees which was money I just simply didn’t have. In the end, I had to stick it on my credit card.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">But could have been all avoided if I had factored it in upfront.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It might seem illogical, but some lenders may charge you a fee for the privilege of applying for a loan. Banks have to pay processors and lawyers to do the loan. Even for so-called “fee-free” loans, there are sometimes settlement and documentation fees.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The application fees are generally around $500-$600, though they can be more than $1000 depending on the loan and lender.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Borrowing fees can include:</strong></p>\n<ul class=\"ol1\">\n<li class=\"li3\"><b>1. Loan application/establishment fees—</b>some lenders charge on the initial draw down of your loan</li>\n<li class=\"li3\"><b>2. Document preparation fees—</b>lenders may charge this to prepare your home loan contracts before approval</li>\n<li class=\"li3\"><b>3. Bank valuation fees—</b>usually waived but if you need a valuation they may charge you</li>\n<li class=\"li3\"><b>4. Other fees—</b>annual fees! Sneaky annual fees can cost up to $400 per year.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>How much you would need to contribute to a $300,000 property purchase without the first home owners’ grant in Brisbane, including a few minor bank fees.</i></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Fortunately, it is super easy to manage these fees, and in most cases, you can get them waived.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Talk to your broker and make sure they take you through all the upfront borrowing costs to ensure your budget works. With our clients at Hunter Galloway, nine times out of ten we get the annual fee waived.</p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><b>Government Fees</b></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">Government fees are one of the secret stings It is different to stamp duty—which we will talk about in a minute.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Government fees when buying a home in Queensland include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1. Registration on the mortgage—</b>typically $187 in Queensland</li>\n<li><b>2. Registration of discharge of mortgage—</b>$187 in Queensland</li>\n<li><b>3. Registration of transfer</b>—ranges from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p3\">You’ll pay for the privilege of formally registering your mortgage, while the cost of transferring the property into your ownership will also fall to you, as the new owner.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><b>Registration of transfer fee is the biggest sting.</b></p>\n<p class=\"p3\">For example, if you are a first home buyer in Queensland purchasing a brand-new home for $400,000—where the stamp duty is being waived—you will still need to pay $957 in transfer duty!</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Think of transfer duty as just another tax when buying a home. Unlike bank fees, there isn’t any way around these and no discounts to be had.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Just be aware of them, and make sure your broker factors them in upfront because it can be another few hundred to a thousand dollars that you didn’t know you needed!</p>\n<h2 class=\"p3\"><b>Stamp Duty</b></h2>\n<p class=\"p3\">This is one of the few non-optional upfront costs for buying a house.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/stamp-duty-calculator-queensland/\">Stamp duty on property purchase</a> is a state government tax. As such, the amount that is payable will vary from state to state.

But if you are buying a unit, apartment or townhouse in a complex you will need to pay strata fees.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Strata fees, also called levies, are contributions generally paid quarterly into the strata (or body corporate) bank account. These fees are used to fund the ongoing expenses of your building complex, such as cleaning, gardening, electricity, building maintenance, and plumbing.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Knowing the strata fees is critically important because once you buy the place, you are responsible to make these contributions every three months until you sell the place.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">If you are buying a home in a complex, you need to get a copy of the strata reports.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>This can save you big bucks.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">When I was buying my first home, I almost didn’t bother getting the strata report—I didn’t want to pay. Luckily I sucked it up and spent the money.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">If I hadn’t paid for the strata report, I would have been up for $9,000 in special levies in the first year of owning my property.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><b>Yeah, it would have cost me over $9,000</b></p>\n<p class=\"p3\">I was buying into a building that had massive water leaking issues, and serious concrete cancer—all stuff that you couldn’t see from the outside or in a building and pest report.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">But the strata report detailed this, and also went on to explain that the strata was needing to raise additional contributions from the unit owners.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Needless to say, I moved on to a different property and avoided the financial heart attack.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Your lawyer can arrange a strata report. In some states you need to pay for these and in others you can request a copy from the body corporate manager. Either way, it’s worth the effort—if the strata fees are really high, or they are getting raised up, you can bet your bottom dollar they will be coming out of your pocket. Best be prepared.</p>\n<h2 class=\"p3\"><b>Home and Contents Insurance</b></h2>\n<p class=\"p3\">A lot of buyers think that they don’t need home and contents insurance, but it’s vitally important. Home and contents insurance will protect you house if there is fire, theft, flood, or accidental damage. We’ll cover this in more detail in our SETTLE section. For now, just be aware that you will need home and contents insurance before settlement is complete.</p>\n<p class=\"p13\"><span class=\"s1\">The good news is you can go online to source or arrange to speak with your mortgage broker. At Hunter Galloway we work with Allianz and can help arrange home and contents insurance for you—Allianz gives our clients 90 days free cover until settlement.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p3\"><b>Legal Costs (Solicitor/Conveyancer fees)</b></h2>\n<p class=\"p3\">You’ll need to pay a legal professional or <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/what-does-a-conveyancer-do/\">conveyancer</a> to conduct title searches, make a strata report (if you’re buying a townhouse or a unit), review a contract of sale not always required in Queensland), and arrange settlement details.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><b>Why isn’t a review of contracts required in Queensland?</b></p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Because we have contracts of sale with standard terms and conditions. In other states like New South Wales, contract terms and conditions can vary from contract to contract.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">If you are buying at auction you need to engage a solicitor or conveyancer before you bid.</p>\n<p class=\"p13\"><span class=\"s1\">Whereas if purchasing by private treaty (i.e. a normal purchase) you can engage a solicitor or conveyancer during the cooling-off period.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p13\"><span class=\"s1\">In general, conveyancers charge a flat fee, while solicitors commonly charge by the hour—with the amount paid depending on how complex your purchase is.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p13\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>A few tips we give our Hunter Galloway clients on legal costs are:</b></span></p>\n<ol class=\"ol1\">\n<li class=\"li13\"><span class=\"s1\">Obtain the searches recommended by the solicitor.</span></li>\n<li class=\"li13\"><span class=\"s1\">We don’t recommend one-person operations—if the solicitor/conveyancer is away or sick there is no one to attend settlement for you!</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"p13\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Approximate cost is $1000 to $2000, depending on the searches conducted. </b></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p16\"><b>Building and Pest Reports</b></h2>\n<p class=\"p13\"><span class=\"s1\">Building and pest reports are what I would consider the most common, and almost mandatory cost when buying a house. These reports look at the building (structural soundness) and pests, to check you aren’t flatting with termites or white ants. A typical building inspection for a four-bedroom home can cost $400 – $500 and pest inspection $200 –$300. The good news is, you can save a few hundred dollars by getting a combined building and pest report for around $500 – $600. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p13\"><span class=\"s1\">You’ll learn more about building and pest reports in the SEARCH section. For now, just be aware of the cost and factor this into your budgeting process.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p13\"><span class=\"s4\"><b>Moving and Connection Costs</b></span></h2>\n<p class=\"p13\"><span class=\"s1\">Moving costs might seem like an obvious one, but have you budgeted for it?</span></p>\n<p class=\"p13\"><span class=\"s1\">Okay, wise guy, if you have, then have you also factored in connection costs?</span></p>\n<p class=\"p13\"><span class=\"s1\">Depending on how far you are moving (and how much stuff you have to move) removalist fees can also add a few thousand dollars to your upfront costs when buying a home.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p13\"><span class=\"s1\">For a local move (i.e. within the same city), <a href=\"https://www.homeimprovementpages.com.au/\"><span class=\"s5\">Home Improvement Pages</span></a> recommends you set aside anywhere from $300 to $3500. For an interstate move, removalist costs can be several thousand dollars more than this.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p13\"><span class=\"s1\">Backloading is great for moving interstate; I used it when moving from Sydney to Brisbane and it was under $1000 to move a bunch of stuff.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p13\"><span class=\"s1\">The downside of backloading is it takes ages for your stuff to arrive.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p13\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>One thing you probably didn’t know is when moving into an apartment you need to organise with the building manager beforehand to book out lift/elevators—and be aware of where you can and can’t park. </b></span></p>\n<p class=\"p13\"><span class=\"s1\">Another good news story is on connection costs.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p13\"><span class=\"s1\">With the increase in competition in the energy market in Brisbane, I have found you can get any connection costs waived provided you sign up for a 12-month contract. Phone around and see what you can do, but companies like <a href=\"https://www.originenergy.com.au/for-home/moving.html\"><span class=\"s5\">Origin</span></a> make this pretty easy when moving into a new home.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p13\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Example of the Costs When Buying a Home in Brisbane for Over $500,000</b></span></h2>\n<p class=\"p13\"><span class=\"s1\">Let’s go through an example to show exactly what it would cost to buy a first home in Brisbane. This is a house that Nathan (one of our customers) was looking at buying when he came to us for help with his home loan.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p13\"><span class=\"s1\">Nathan isn’t a first home buyer, so he only gets a partial <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/hidden-costs-buying-home-brisbane/#Stamp-duty-when-buying-home\"><span class=\"s5\">stamp duty concession</span></a> on his home purchase and finds the perfect unit on Margaret Street in Brisbane for $555,000. He has around $75,000 in savings, so a little bit over 10%.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p13\"><span class=\"s1\">In this example, Nathan is wanting to capitalise or add the lenders mortgage insurance to the loan amount so he doesn’t need to pay this upfront.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p13\"><span class=\"s4\"><b>Table of Costs of Buying a $555,000 House in Brisbane</b></span></p>\n<table class=\"t1\"

If that’s you, don’t stress too much. Your dreams of owning a home don’t need to come to an end just yet—it is possible to buy a home with a small deposit, or even no deposit at all!<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Here’s how:</p>\n<h2 class=\"p9\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>How to Buy With No Deposit at All</b></span></span></h2>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bNmGUhrEk98?feature=oembed&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;rel=0&amp;color=WHITE\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p class=\"p10\"><span class=\"s1\">If you have a strong income, and not a lot of savings, it might be possible for you to buy without any deposit at all.<b> </b>In fact, in some situations, you can borrow up to 105% of the purchase price.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p10\"><span class=\"s1\">Here are some ways that you can buy a home without a deposit:</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p10\"><span class=\"s1\"><b><a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/guarantor-home-loan/\">Guarantor Loans</a>: Borrow up to 105% of the purchase price. </b></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"s1\">Buying a property with your parents as a guarantor lets you borrow up to 105% of the purchase price! This means you don’t need any savings as your parents provide a guarantee secured on their property. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"s1\">The idea is for you to get into the property market sooner. Once you have paid off part of your loan or your property has increased in value you can remove the guarantee.</span> <span class=\"s1\">Guarantor loans have become very popular in recent years as they cost less than standard home loans, they allow you to buy without a deposit and some lenders now allow you to limit the size of the guarantee.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p10\"><span class=\"s1\">For example, if you want to buy a house, you ask your parents for help. They might not have enough cash to offer, but you can use their house as security. This method was not allowed in the past, but now a number of lenders have introduced policies that allow a person to use another property as a security.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_8063\" style=\"width: 899px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-8063\" class=\"size-full wp-image-8063\" src=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/guarantor-home-loan.jpg\" alt=\"guarantor-home-loan\" width=\"889\" height=\"650\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-8063\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Example of a typical guarantor home loan structure</p></div>\n<p class=\"p10\"><span class=\"s1\">They allow your immediate family members to offer their house as a co-security. In other words, the financial institution will accept that property as a substitute for a cash deposit.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p10\"><span class=\"s1\">Using the property as co-security has its pros and cons. The advantage of using this policy is that there is no need for mortgage insurance, which saves a lot of money. On the other hand, the drawback of signing up for this policy is that your immediate family members get stuck with you.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p10\"><span class=\"s1\">They are eventually released from this obligation once you pay down the loan amount or if the value of property increases. This option will allow you to buy a home with no deposit if you are buying a home for the first time and entitled to get a first home owners’ grant. It will also enable you to cover your costs, such as legal expenses or transfer costs.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Read More: <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/guarantor-home-loan/\">Guarantor Home Loans </a></strong></p>\n<h2><span class=\"s1\"><b>Gifted Funds: Borrow up to 80% plus your gift.</b></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"s1\">Around 50 – 60% of first home buyers receive help from their parents; gifted funds work if your parents can give you 5 – 15% of the purchase price. And while this isn’t available for everyone, it might help you get your foot in the door.</span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"s1\"><b><a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/first-home-owners-grant-qld/\">First Home Owners Grant</a>: Get up to $15,000 from the government. </b></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"s1\">In Queensland, you may be eligible for the first home owners’ grant which is currently $15,000 that the government will give you towards your first home purchase. </span></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bk9LxMKTSPw?feature=oembed&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;rel=0&amp;color=WHITE\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p><span class=\"s1\">To be eligible you need to be a first home owner, and you need to either buy or build a brand-new home that is below $750,000. The good news is you can use this $15,000 towards your deposit! So, for example, on a $300,000 property, you need to provide 5% deposit, or $15,000—so the first home owners’ grant can help you get into the property market without any deposit at all.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/first-home-owners-grant-qld/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9244\" src=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/First-Home-Owners-Grant-QLD.jpg\" alt=\"First Home Owners Grant QLD\" width=\"1080\" height=\"675\" /></a></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>The QLD first home owners’ grant is still $15,000 and can be used towards brand-new purchases (or constructions).</i></span></p>\n<p class=\"p10\"><span class=\"s1\">Bear in mind that when you apply for a <a href=\"https://www.evernote.com/OutboundRedirect.action?dest=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.huntergalloway.com.au%252Fcan-buy-home-without-deposit%252F\"><span class=\"s4\">no deposit home loan</span></a>, lenders apply very strict criteria, including having good credit, with a well-maintained repayment history, stable income sources such as a regular job and consistent payments, as well as a common property type—banks don’t like strange properties like caravans or removable houses.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p10\"><span class=\"s1\">If you are planning on using one of the options above, make sure to sort out your finances as early as possible. If you are relying on a deposit being gifted from your parents, getting a guarantor loan or relying on the first home owners’ grant, there can be a bit of back and forth to have the funds available and ready in time for settlement. You’re much better off being prepared and avoiding the stress of worrying if the money is going to make it into your bank account in time.</span></p>\n<p>Read More: <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/first-home-owners-grant-qld/\">First Home Owners Grant QLD 2019 </a></p>\n<h2><strong>Be realistic about your budget</strong></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">A bank might be able to lend you a large amount but should you borrow it all? This is the reality: it’s not always about what you can borrow but what you should borrow.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Understanding what you should borrow is important so you can continue to live within your means and still have some spare cash left over for your weekly avo on toast!</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">There are a number of added costs when it comes to buying a house besides stamp duty and other settlement costs and fees, such as council and water rates, maintenance and repairs, and the added risk of interest rates rising.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_8054\" style=\"width: 789px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-8054\" class=\"size-full wp-image-8054\" src=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cost-of-mortgage-increase.png\" alt=\"cost-of-mortgage-increase\" width=\"779\" height=\"439\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-8054\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">As you can see above, based on a relatively small mortgage of $200,000 a 1% increase in interest rate will increase repayments by almost $100 per month or over a 10% increase in the total repayment amount.</p></div>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><strong>If you borrow too much, you run the risk of overextending and getting the wrong home loan.</strong></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">I personally found it hard to accept how expensive some properties were when I first started looking—and this is completely common and normal.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Every home buyer knows the feeling—you’re looking for a home that fits your budget, but there’s that much more expensive property that looks so much more appealing!</p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><b>Your first home doesn’t need to be your home forever.</b></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">Buying a home that’s way out of your price range could well derail your finances in the future. It’s human nature for us to want a little more than we can afford, and there’s always a real estate agent who’ll talk you to the next level.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">But don’t be tempted—the bank has usually offered you a borrowing limit for good reasons based on your ability to repay the loan.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9616\" src=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/what-can-i-afford-in-real-life.jpg\" alt=\"what can i afford in real life\" width=\"683\" height=\"512\" /></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Spending more than you can sensibly afford leaves you exposed to potential financial shocks, including rises in interest rates. You must also allow for changes in your future circumstances.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I’ll show you how to “have your smashed avo and eat it too” in the SEARCH section of the book. You’ll learn how to set up your property search for success, including how to expand your search to find a house that gives you everything you need without a big price tag.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">For now, just keep in mind that there’s no sense sacrificial your financial and mental health for that “perfect” house. If you can come up with a reasonable budget now—and you stick to it— you can focus on houses within your budget and avoid the heartbreak.</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"hub_pr_n_arrows\"><i class=\"fa fa-angle-left\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i></div>\n<div class=\"hub_previous\">Previous</div>\n<div class=\"hub_previous_link\"><a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/hub/know-your-budget/borrowing-power/\">Maximise your borrowing power</a></div>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"hub_pr_n_arrows\"><i class=\"fa fa-angle-right\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i></div>\n<div class=\"hub_next\">Next</div>\n<div class=\"hub_next_link\"><a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/hub/know-your-budget/cost-of-buying-a-home/\">The true costs of buying a home</a></div>\n<p><link rel='stylesheet' href='https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/OwlCarousel2/2.1.3/assets/owl.carousel.min.css'><script src='https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/OwlCarousel2/2.1.3/owl.carousel.min.js'></script><script src='https://use.fontawesome.com/826a7e3dce.js'></script></p>\n<style>.carousel-wrap { margin: 90px auto; padding: 0 5%; width: 80%; position: relative;}/* fix blank or flashing items on carousel */.owl-carousel .item { position: relative; z-index: 100;  -webkit-backface-visibility: hidden; }/* end fix */.owl-nav > div { margin-top: -26px; position: absolute; top: 50%; color: #cdcbcd;}.owl-nav i { font-size: 52px;}.owl-nav .owl-prev { left: -30px;}.owl-nav .owl-next { right: -30px;}</style>\n<p><script>jQuery('.owl-carousel').owlCarousel({ loop: true, margin: 10, nav: true, navText:  --> \"<i class='fa fa-caret-left'></i>\", \"<i class='fa fa-caret-right'></i>\" ], autoplay: false, autoplayHoverPause: false, responsive: { 0: { items: 1 }, 600: { items: 3 }, 1000: { items: 3 } }})</script></p>"

This is usually judged by your credit report, which contains information on how much you have previously borrowed and if you have repaid your previous loans or credit cards on time.</li>\n<li class=\"li3\"><b>☑️ Capacity:</b>&nbsp;This measures your ability to repay the loan based on your current income, and also around your job stability—specifically how long you’ve been in your current job or industry. Some lenders like to see you have been in a particular job for at least 2 years, while others are happy to lend to you as soon as you have your first payslip.</li>\n<li class=\"li3\"><b>☑️ Capital:</b>&nbsp;Capital refers to your contribution or the deposit you are providing towards the purchase or refinance. In general, the more capital, or deposit you contribute, the lower the risk the bank sees you as. This is why borrowers with less than 20% deposit are seen as a slightly higher risk, and so the banks will obtain lenders mortgage insurance to protect themselves.</li>\n<li class=\"li3\"><b>☑️ Collateral:</b>&nbsp;Collateral is what secures the loan. In the case of a home loan, this is your property. Again, different lenders have different criteria, for example, some love lending on smaller units, some will not lend on units at all. If you aren’t sure about a specific property, you can chat to our brokers to double check.</li>\n<li class=\"li3\"><b>☑️ Conditions:&nbsp;</b>Conditions means the particulars of the loan, like interest rate, loan amount, loan term (which is generally 25 or 30 years in Australia) and loan purpose.. In recent times owner-occupied loans (a home loan to buy a house for you to live in) are more desirable for lenders compared to an investment property. This means you can get a larger home loan discount for an owner-occupied home.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Tip: If you are thinking about switching jobs in the future, the bank will ask about gaps in your employment history or a reduction in income over the past few years. If you’re currently in the loan application process, it’s best not to change jobs if you can avoid it as it could impact your ability to get financing even after you’ve been approved.</b></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_8247\" style=\"width: 410px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-8247\" class=\"size-full wp-image-8247\" src=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/positive-credit-report.png\" alt=\"positive-credit-report\" width=\"400\" height=\"250\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-8247\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Your credit score can impact your borrowing if you have had issues in the past with missed repayments.</p></div>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><strong>Your borrowing power can vary a lot between different lenders, but switching banks isn’t the only way you can increase this amount. </strong></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>You can also do it by:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1. Improving your credit rating.&nbsp;</b>If you have a good credit score and very few recent credit inquiries, banks are going to be more willing to lend you money than if you have unpaid defaults or other credit issues in the past.</li>\n<li><b>2. Removing defaults.</b>&nbsp;If you do have defaults, make sure you have paid them and even try contacting the company to see if they can remove the default once it has been repaid. Otherwise, just make sure you get into the habit of paying off your credit cards on time.</li>\n<li><b>3. Ditching your credit cards.</b>&nbsp;Look at your spending patterns along with the credit limit available and try to reduce the limit, or even close the account if possible. A credit card limit of $10,000 can reduce your borrowing power by up to $50,000</li>\n<li><b>4. Pay off personal loans.</b>&nbsp;If you have car loans, personal loans, a HECS-HELP debt, zipPay or other loans, this can really affect your borrowing power.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>If possible, aim to pay off any loans you can before buying so you can maximise your borrowing potential.</li>\n<li><b>5. Try to get a pay rise.</b>&nbsp;This option is clearly not possible in all circumstances. But a pay rise as small as $5,000 could be all you need to get that dream home—it can’t hurt to ask.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\">A home loan is something you are committing to for years, if not decades. The average loan term is 20 to 25 years, so the banks want to make sure that you will be able to continue to make payments in the future.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To work this out, the banks will look to see if your income has been stable and constant over the past one to two years and if it’s likely to continue. They will typically want to see some documentation of your income history, like group certificates and payslips.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">If your income is variable, for example, if you are self-employed or paid a commission, you may need to submit some extra documentation and be prepared for some banks to be slightly conservative in their income calculations. Also, keep in mind that not all income is considered equal. For example, banks will typically only count 75-80% of rental income, as it is considered riskier than employment income.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I will show you how to get a more accurate idea of what you can afford and what your repayments will be, but as an estimate,&nbsp;<span class=\"s1\"><b>the banks will lend you around five to six times your gross annual salary.</b></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This is your annual salary before tax, not including superannuation or any other bonuses.</p>\n<h2 class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\"><b>Are Different Types of Jobs More Preferred Than Others By the Banks?</b></span></h2>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">The acceptable job statuses of preferred borrowers are as follows:</span></p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li6\"><strong>☑️ Permanent Employment (full time or part-time)</strong> – This is what most people would know as a regular job, sometimes referred to as PAYG, or pay as you go employment. In this case, you are directly employed to work for an employer, and also directly paid by that employer. This is the most preferred type of employment by the banks, and in some cases has no minimum employment period to get a home loan, just a single payslip.</li>\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s2\"><strong>☑️ Contract employment (full time or part time)</strong>—The borrower must be working for at least a year with a current employer, or have a minimum of two-year continuous experience in the same industry. If a person is on a probation period, the strength of their loan application and financial position matters a lot.</span></li>\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s2\"><strong>☑️ Casual income</strong>—He or she must have at least one year of experience in the current employment to be able to qualify for a loan. If casual employment is their only source of income, the application assessment is done on a merit basis, keeping in mind the borrower’s financial position.</span></li>\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s2\">☑️<strong> Self-employed</strong>—In this case, a person must have been doing the same business for at least two financial years. The lenders may also consider the application if a borrower only has one year of experience in their current business, but at least two years of experience in previous employment within a similar business. However, the overall strength of the application will be taken into consideration for that matter.</span></li>\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s2\"><strong>☑️ Second job</strong>—A person must have at least one year of experience in their current job.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<div id=\"attachment_8816\" style=\"width: 630px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-8816\" class=\"size-full wp-image-8816\" src=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/loan-declined-uber-income-investment-property.jpg\" alt=\"loan declined uber income investment property\" width=\"620\" height=\"400\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-8816\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Some banks love, and some banks hate secondary income from jobs like Uber</p></div>\n<h2 class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\"><b>Will the Bank Accept Overtime, Shift Allowance or Any Other Types of Unusual Income?</b></span></h2>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">If the duration of employment is met, 100% of the borrower’s income will be accepted for review by the lender.

It&#8217;s important to know what these mean.</p>\n<h2><strong>What is LVR?</strong></h2>\n<p>LVR is the loan-to-value ratio. It is the percentage of the money you borrow for a home loan compared to the value of the property. It is calculated as the loan amount divided by the home value. The banks use LVR to determine if they will approve your home loan.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OuD2dQQCQfQ?feature=oembed&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;rel=0&amp;color=WHITE\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">﻿</span></iframe></p>\n<p>Typically, if your LVR is above 80% you will need to pay LMI or lenders mortgage insurance to cover the bank in case you default on your loan.</p>\n<p>In the example below an $80,000 loan for a $100,000 property purchase would mean an 80% LVR. As the LVR is 80% and below it would not have LMI, or lenders mortgage insurance, payable.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_8046\" style=\"width: 864px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-8046\" class=\"size-full wp-image-8046\" src=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/First-Home-Buyer-LVR-80.png\" alt=\"First-Home-Buyer-LVR-80\" width=\"854\" height=\"383\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-8046\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">An example of 80% LVR, this was calculated by dividing the loan amount of $80,000 by the home value of $100,000 times 100.&nbsp;</p></div>\n<p><strong>Read More: <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/lvr-calculator/\">Try the LVR Calculator</a></strong></p>\n<h2><strong>What is LMI?</strong></h2>\n<p>LMI or lenders mortgage insurance is a one-off fee payable by you, the borrower, to cover the bank&#8211;it&#8217;s insurance that covers the bank. While it benefits you by being able to buy a home with less than a 20% deposit, it doesn&#8217;t cover you and is just for the bank.</p>\n<p>LMI stands for lenders mortgage insurance.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-vw_oRFZ3JA?feature=oembed&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;rel=0&amp;color=WHITE\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">﻿</span></iframe></p>\n<p>This cost is a sliding scale&#8211;the smaller your deposit, the more insurance you&#8217;ll pay.

Genuine savings show the bank that the applicant has a bit of skin in the game, a bit of hurt money that you have saved up yourself.</p>\n<p>Most lenders like to see 5% of the property purchase price saved in a bank account for 3 months but there are a few exceptions to this rule.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cYZNEYZ6amw?feature=oembed&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;rel=0&amp;color=WHITE\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">﻿</span></iframe></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>✅ Be currently renting, and have at least 6 months clean rental history</strong></li>\n<li><strong>✅ Lenders consider the following forms of <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/what-is-genuine-savings/\">genuine savings</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong>✅ Savings held or accumulated over 3 months</strong></li>\n<li><strong>✅ Shares or managed funds held for 3 months or greater</strong></li>\n<li><strong>✅ Equity in real estate or property</strong></li>\n<li><strong>✅ Term deposits held for 3 months or greater</strong></li>\n<li><strong>✅ Funds held in <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/first-home-super-saver-scheme/\">First Home Super Saver Scheme (FHSSS)</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong>✅ Some lenders allow exceptions if rent has been paid for the last 3 months or greater</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The majority of lenders agree on what makes up genuine savings, but where they differ is when genuine savings are required. Some lenders only need to see genuine savings if you have less than a 10% deposit (90% LVR) whereas others want to see it if you have less than a 15% deposit (over 85% LVR).</p>\n<p>To play it safe you can assume <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/what-is-genuine-savings/\">genuine savings</a> is required when lending over 85-90% of the property value.</p>\n<p>The lender generally wants to see 5% of the purchase price held for 3 months or longer – in some cases (particularly for investment properties) lenders require greater than 5% of the purchase price as <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/what-is-genuine-savings/\">genuine savings</a>.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that the lender only requires 5% (of the purchase price) held for 3 months or longer. Which means funds for stamp duty and other costs do not have to be held for 3 months or greater.</p>\n<p>For example, if you’re purchasing a property for $500,000 then <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/what-is-genuine-savings/\">genuine savings</a> of 5% of this purchase price is $25,000. You’d need to hold $25,000 for 3 months or greater to meet the genuine savings policy plus hold enough funds to cover stamp duty/other costs applicable. Also be aware that lender mortgage insurance will be applicable.</p>\n<h2><strong>Can I use what I pay in rent as genuine savings?</strong></h2>\n<p>If you have good rental history, some lenders will consider making an exception to the genuine savings policy and consider deposit from other sources like gifted funds from your parents that don’t need to be held for over 3 months.<br />\nTo use rent as genuine savings you need to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>✅ Be currently renting, and have at least 6 months clean rental history</strong></li>\n<li><strong>✅ Be currently renting via a licensed property manager (i.e. not a private rental, or living at home with your parents)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>✅ Ensure the tenants on the lease are the same as the people who will be on the home loan application</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Good news is if you can fit these criteria, the rent you have paid over the past 6 months will be considered instead of showing genuine savings and therefore you can use deposit sourced from ’non-genuine’ savings like a gift from your parents.</p>\n<p>You will need a copy of the rental ledger, or reference letter from your property manager as evidence to use rent as <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/what-is-genuine-savings/\">genuine savings</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Read More: <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/what-is-genuine-savings/\">What is genuine savings?</a></strong></p>\n<h2><strong>If I rent, do I still need a deposit?</strong></h2>\n<p>You will still need to provide a deposit for your home loan even if you are renting.</p>\n<p>We recommend you have been 8-10% of the property purchase price in savings, or you can work with less if you have a guarantor.</p>\n<p>Now that we&#8217;ve covered these few key financial terms, let&#8217;s look at your borrowing power in more detail.</p>\n<div class=\"hub_pr_n_arrows\"><i class=\"fa fa-angle-left\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i></div>\n<div class=\"hub_previous\">Previous</div>\n<div class=\"hub_previous_link\"><a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/hub/know-your-budget/what-can-i-afford/\">What can I afford?</a></div>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"hub_pr_n_arrows\"><i class=\"fa fa-angle-right\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i></div>\n<div class=\"hub_next\">Next</div>\n<div class=\"hub_next_link\"><a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/hub/know-your-budget/borrowing-power/\">Maximise your borrowing power</a></div>\n<p><link rel='stylesheet' href='https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/OwlCarousel2/2.1.3/assets/owl.carousel.min.css'><script src='https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/OwlCarousel2/2.1.3/owl.carousel.min.js'></script><script src='https://use.fontawesome.com/826a7e3dce.js'></script></p>\n<style>.carousel-wrap { margin: 90px auto; padding: 0 5%; width: 80%; position: relative;}/* fix blank or flashing items on carousel */.owl-carousel .item { position: relative; z-index: 100;  -webkit-backface-visibility: hidden; }/* end fix */.owl-nav > div { margin-top: -26px; position: absolute; top: 50%; color: #cdcbcd;}.owl-nav i { font-size: 52px;}.owl-nav .owl-prev { left: -30px;}.owl-nav .owl-next { right: -30px;}</style>\n<p><script>jQuery('.owl-carousel').owlCarousel({ loop: true, margin: 10, nav: true, navText:  --> \"<i class='fa fa-caret-left'></i>\", \"<i class='fa fa-caret-right'></i>\" ], autoplay: false, autoplayHoverPause: false, responsive: { 0: { items: 1 }, 600: { items: 3 }, 1000: { items: 3 } }})</script></p>"

When you&#8217;re borrowing hundreds of thousands of dollars from the bank, you want to make sure that you can afford it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The last thing you would want to do is to overextend and get a loan that puts you in financial stress. Believe me, I know. I&#8217;ve been there.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Let me start with a quick story</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Way back in 2009-2010 I was on my way to becoming a property mogul (in my own head). I had just bought my second property, a small unit on Newton Street in Alexandria which I was planning on renovating and flipping for a massive profit&#8230; so I thought.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_8183\" style=\"width: 366px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-8183\" class=\"wp-image-8183 size-full\" src=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/first-home-purchase-brisbane.jpg\" alt=\"first-home-purchase-brisbane\" width=\"356\" height=\"267\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-8183\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The unit I nearly lost from overextending myself.</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was around this time that the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) started increasing interest rates, and in the space of six months, the interest rates had increased on my loan by 1.50%.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My interest rate went from a barely manageable 6% to 7.50%. That may not seem like much, but my monthly interest repayments went up from $3500 &#8212; which I could only JUST afford &#8212; to $4375 per month. That&#8217;s a jump of $875 per month!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being the gung-ho property investor that I was, I hadn&#8217;t left myself any room for increased payments. I literally had no money left when I was paying $3500 per month, so finding $875 was literally impossible and I was in deep, deep mortgage stress.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I managed to maintain my repayments for a short time (using borrowed money and a cash advance on my credit card) but I ultimately had to sell my second property quickly to prevent myself from getting into more and more debt.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I walked away having made no profit on the entire exercise and put myself through hell in the process. I even risked losing my home!</span></p>\n<h2><b>The lesson: Overextending is bad. Make sure you know what you can afford to borrow.</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, how exactly do you find out how much you can borrow? And once you know how much you </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">can</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> borrow, how much </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">should you</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> borrow?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It starts with understanding some of the basics of loans and finance.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_8040\" style=\"width: 672px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-8040\" class=\"size-full wp-image-8040\" src=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/First-home-buyer-broker.jpg\" alt=\"First-home-buyer-broker\" width=\"662\" height=\"437\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-8040\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The home buying equation is simple how much you can buy only depends on 2 things &#8211; your income and your deposit.</p></div>\n<h2><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><b>Your borrowing power = income + deposit</b></span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first step in understanding how much you can afford to borrow is to learn about borrowing power.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Borrowing power is a term the banks use to talk about the maximum loan amount that a bank may offer you based on your current circumstances. This is based primarily on your income and your deposit, although a few other factors do come into play as well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We&#8217;ll go further into the details of your borrowing power and how it relates to your home buying budget in more detail as we go along.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For now, think of borrowing power as similar to the credit limit on your credit card. &nbsp;The bank is telling you how much money they would offer to you, but you don&#8217;t need to borrow the whole amount. Just like a credit card, our goal is to maximise your borrowing power. Not so you can go out and spend it all, but because it gives you more options.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are three more financial terms that you need to be across before we get into the details: LVR, LMR and Genuine Savings.</span></p>\n<p><iframe width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pLUPoez9rU0?feature=oembed&#038;modestbranding=1&#038;showinfo=0&#038;rel=0&#038;color=WHITE\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p>\n<div class=\"hub_pr_n_arrows\"><i class=\"fa fa-angle-left\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i></div>\n<div class=\"hub_previous\">Previous</div>\n<div class=\"hub_previous_link\"><a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/hub/know-your-budget/\">Know Your Budget</a></div>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"hub_pr_n_arrows\"><i class=\"fa fa-angle-right\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i></div>\n<div class=\"hub_next\">Next</div>\n<div class=\"hub_next_link\"><a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/hub/know-your-budget/finance-basics/ \">Understand LVR, LMI and Genuine Savings</a></div>\n<p><link rel='stylesheet' href='https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/OwlCarousel2/2.1.3/assets/owl.carousel.min.css'><script src='https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/OwlCarousel2/2.1.3/owl.carousel.min.js'></script><script src='https://use.fontawesome.com/826a7e3dce.js'></script></p>\n<style>.carousel-wrap { margin: 90px auto; padding: 0 5%; width: 80%; position: relative;}/* fix blank or flashing items on carousel */.owl-carousel .item { position: relative; z-index: 100;  -webkit-backface-visibility: hidden; }/* end fix */.owl-nav > div { margin-top: -26px; position: absolute; top: 50%; color: #cdcbcd;}.owl-nav i { font-size: 52px;}.owl-nav .owl-prev { left: -30px;}.owl-nav .owl-next { right: -30px;}</style>\n<p><script>jQuery('.owl-carousel').owlCarousel({ loop: true, margin: 10, nav: true, navText:  --> \"<i class='fa fa-caret-left'></i>\", \"<i class='fa fa-caret-right'></i>\" ], autoplay: false, autoplayHoverPause: false, responsive: { 0: { items: 1 }, 600: { items: 3 }, 1000: { items: 3 } }})</script></p>"

Finding the right home to buy is hard enough – and that’s only one of the many steps you need to take before you can move in and start living the Great Australian Dream.</p>\n<p>With so many things to take care of, the process can be stressful and overwhelming at times.</p>\n<p>Luckily, you don’t have to do it alone. Here at Hunter Galloway we’ve helped hundreds of first home buyers take that first step into owning property. We’d love to help you do the same.</p>\n<p>Read on to find out everything you need to know about buying your first property, or if you’d like to speak to someone you can book a free, no obligations assessment with one of our brokers.</p>\n<p>Book a free assessment using the link below and our experienced team of brokers will arrange a time to speak with you about your needs and make sure you can buy your dream home without all of the stress.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a alt=\"\" class=\"btn_yellow rc_open on_page\" style=\"margin: 0 auto; margin-top: 20px;\">Get a Free Assessment</a></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><strong>Tips for First Home Buyers</strong></h2>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"wpb_text_column wpb_content_element \">\n<div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n<h3><strong>Do the groundwork before you start your property search</strong></h3>\n<p>Before you even start looking at houses, you need to do some groundwork. First and foremost, you need to take a hard look at your finances. You should find out the size of loan that you will qualify for and look at what kind of repayments you can afford without overextending yourself.</p>\n<p>It’s also worth taking some time to look at the various grants that are available to you as a first home buyer. For example, the QLD government will give you up to $20,000 if you are buying a new house or apartment.</p>\n<p>The best thing to do before you start really searching for a home is to get pre-approval for a home loan. This means that you know exactly how much you can afford to pay and will help you narrow down your search.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"wpb_text_column wpb_content_element \">\n<div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n<h3><strong>Do your research and take your time</strong></h3>\n<p>Buying the right house takes a lot of consistent hard work and time. If you just go out and buy the first house that you see, chances are that you will get sub-optimal results.</p>\n<p>Before you start looking, you should write down a list of what you’re looking for. What area would you like to live in? How many bedrooms? What other features would you like to have? What are you willing to compromise on, and what is a ‘must-have’?</p>\n<p>Once you’ve got a good idea of what you’re looking form you should get into a routine of searching for homes. For example, you could dedicate time every evening for research, and plan to dive around and do inspections on weekends.</p>\n<p>There are also plenty of resources that you can use to learn more about property purchase. You can research online, read books, or <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/free-assessment/\">get some advice from an experienced professional</a>.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"wpb_text_column wpb_content_element \">\n<div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><strong>You don&#8217;t have to do it alone</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">There are a lot of steps to consider and paperwork to be completed.

This is a case by case basis as it really comes down to your personal circumstances and income.</p>\n<p>For the first home owner’s grant, the maximum purchase value is $750,000 so anything over that will not qualify for the grant.<br />\nWhen it comes to applying for a home loan, it’s important to have all of your documents ready to go. You will need four different types of documentation: Identification, income, assets, and liabilities. The requirements may vary between lenders, however, the below documents are the standard requirements.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Identification (100 points)</li>\n<li>Birth certificate (70 points)</li>\n<li>Passport (70 points)</li>\n<li>Citizenship certificates (70 points)</li>\n<li>Diplomatic documents and official documents issued to refugees (70 points)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Secondary: </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Driver’s licence (40 points)</li>\n<li>State or Territory issued photo ID card (40 points)</li>\n<li>Photo ID issued by tertiary education institute (40 points)</li>\n<li>Photo card issued by banking institution where you have been a customer for at least 12 months (40 points)</li>\n<li>Public service ID card including your photo and signature (40 points)</li>\n<li>License or permit issued by State, Territory or Commonwealth government, such as a boating license (40 points)</li>\n<li>Letter confirming your identity from referee you’ve known for at least 12 months (40 points)</li>\n<li>Mortgage documents (35 points)</li>\n<li>Council rates notice (35 points)</li>\n<li>Credit card statement (25 points)</li>\n<li>Foreign driver’s license (25 points)</li>\n<li>Medicare card (25 points)</li>\n<li>Credit card (must have name and signature) (25 points)</li>\n<li>Utility bill with name and current address (25 points)</li>\n<li>EFTPOS card (must have name and signature) (25 points)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Income:</strong><br />\nIf you’re PAYG you will need to provide payslips from the past three months. Bank statements in some cases also suffice.</p>\n<p>Those who are self-employed will need to apply for a low documentation loan which requires a copy of your most recent assessment from the ATO with individual tax returns from the last financial year along with your Business Activity Statement (BAS).</p>\n<p>Furthermore, if you have multiple forms of income you will need documentation from each one. This includes – rental income, shares, Centrelink income.</p>\n<p><strong>Assets and liabilities </strong><br />\nYour assets and liabilities will be reviewed in order to effectively assess your financial position.</p>\n<p>To separate them, assets are what you own and liabilities are what you owe.</p>\n<p><strong>Miscellaneous documents</strong><br />\nFirst home buyers will be required to complete separate documentation for the grant. Likewise for those applying with a guarantor. Insurance and valuation of the property will also need to be complete and the insurance policy and valuation report will be required.<br />\n</p>\n<div class=\"appeal\">    </p>\n<div class=\"container\">      </p>\n<div class=\"appeal-row\">        <a href=\"#\" class=\"appeal-btn question-next find-loan show-popup\">Find out if you&#8217;re eligible for a loan</a>      </div>\n<p>    </div>\n<p>  </div>\n<p></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" alt=\"\" class=\"btn_yellow rc_open on_page\" style=\"margin: 0 auto;margin-top:20px;\">Get a Free Assessment</a></p>\n<p></p>"

This has no effect on our loan offer as it is a cheaper way for the banks to get you as a customer because they don’t have to pay for the additional processing staff, marketing or premises.</p>\n<p>Best of all for you, at <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/\">Hunter Galloway</a> we are mortgage broking and credit experts so we can answer all of your questions instead of having to transfer you to another department.</p>\n<h3><strong>Is it better to go to my Bank (rather than a Mortgage Broker in Paddington)?</strong></h3>\n<p>Realistically if you are looking for a home loan there are 3 ways to do it &#8211; go to your bank directly, shop around from bank to bank yourself or get a mortgage broker to take care of it for you.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mfaa.com.au/Growth-in-finance-broker-numbers-outpaces-growth-in-new-lending\">Over 50% of Australians</a> use Mortgage Brokers to get their home loan, and while going to your existing bank might seem like the easiest option it could end up costing you in both time in money over the long term.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Banks do not reward loyalty:</strong> If you are an existing banks customer (and have good income) chances are you are getting a good interest rate &#8211; but it might not be the sharpest rate you could qualify for. If you have had your home loan for over 2 years you are probably overpaying, banks don’t tend to pass rate cuts onto existing customers (and won’t tell you about them)! Some banks are even paying up to $2,000 in refinancing rebates to help bring your loans across, <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/free-assessment/\">find out more details here. </a></li>\n<li><strong>Brokers give you more choice in loan products:</strong> Thinking about it logically, would a banker at CBA tell you there was a better deal with ANZ down the street? Bankers can only offer their banks individual products and stick to their bank&#8217;s specific policies &#8211; which is the worst part. Say if you applied for a loan with CBA, and you didn’t quite fit their lending policy the banker isn’t going to tell you that you don’t fit and just get you to apply and hope it gets through. This is one of the reasons why 40% of loan applications have been declined in 2018 &#8211; Don’t take that risk!</li>\n<li><strong>Our Brokers are credit experts:</strong> Bank policies vary a lot between the different banks, and while it can be pretty cut and dry most bank staff just don’t understand the differences. They don’t know, nor are they trained to understand complex situations and how to correctly look at them. This is often why it can take a very long time to process your loan application through a bank and sometimes get your loan declined for no particular reason.  We have a dedicated credit team who deeply understand the various bank&#8217;s policies and will make sure this doesn’t happen to you: Put simply, we won’t apply through a lender who won’t approve your loan.</li>\n<li><strong>Mortgage brokers get better deals:</strong> As brokers, we see lots of deals each week, and can often get a lower interest rater than what the bank will offer you directly. How? Banks want business from brokers, and they will fight harder to win it because they know as brokers we can simply take your business down the street to the next bank.</li>\n<li><strong>It doesn’t cost you extra to use a broker:</strong> Our services do not cost you anything as we are paid directly by the bank. In fact, in a lot of cases you’ll pay much less using a broker than going to the bank because we’ll be able to negotiate an even better deal for you!</li>\n<li><strong>Banks can be really disorganised:</strong> The mortgage process can be complex, and things can go wrong from time to time. Your income documents could go missing from the banker&#8217;s desk, a credit assessor could misunderstand your bank statements or you can get a <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/free-assessment/\">bad property valuation</a>. A mortgage brokers job is to sort these problems and keep your application moving forward. They will take care of the whole process from application to settlement, talking to the credit assessors to make sure no information is lost and liaising with the valuers to get the best possible result.</li>\n<li><strong>Brokers can give you a personal touch:</strong> Mortgage brokers like <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/\">Hunter Galloway</a> are about building long-term relationships with our clients, we want to help you from the moment you get your first home all the way until you are building an investment portfolio. Because we’re credit experts we can answer all of your questions instead of directing you to another department!</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote><p>Hunter Galloway was very organised in handling our loan documentation, kept us up to date on how the application progress was going and provided good options to finance products. Our previous bank kept losing documents daily, very slow and did not keep us up to date with the application process.

For example, if you bought a house for $300,000 and paid 25 percent as a down payment. The home equity, in this case, will be $75,000 i.e., 25 percent of $300,000. However, if the value of a property increases in future to $500,000, and you still owe $225,000, the overall equity stake will increase from 25 percent to 55 percent.</p>\n<p>You can use home equity as collateral in an equity loan. The repayment schedule, interest rate, and terms of a home equity loan are normally fixed. With this loan, you can refinance, buy another property, invest in shares, or renovate a house.</p>\n<p>It allows you to use the equity that has already been paid off. As long as the interest is paid on time, you can redraw any payment previously made. This is why it is suitable for businesses or investors.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in a home equity loan, our team at Hunter Galloway &#8211; <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/mortgage-broker-brisbane/\">Mortgage Broker Brisbane</a> is here to help. <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/contact/\">Contact us</a> for a free assessment.</p>\n<h3><strong>How Does it Work?</strong></h3>\n<p>With a home equity loan, you can get a line of credit up to a certain amount against your home loan. When applying for this loan, your financial situation is assessed by taking into consideration your assets, income and the debt you owe. If the loan is taken our for an investment property, the value of the property is also assessed by a lender.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Who Should Apply for it?</strong></h3>\n<p>A home equity loan can be useful if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You already own a house and looking for another property for investment purposes, or</li>\n<li>You want to renovate a property.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can easily fast track renovating your house through using a home equity loan. It also enables you to buy an investment property without delays. Just make sure that you manage your home loan efficiently to mitigate risk and maximise profit on investment.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Lenders Offering Home Equity Loans</strong></h3>\n<p>Although, every lender charge different fees and interest rates for an equity loan, the features are almost the same. Given below is a list of home equity loans offered by various lenders:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The loan offered by the National Australia Bank includes Amortizing Flexi Plus, National Flexi Plus, Introductory Rate Loan with 3-year Variable Rate, NAB Home Equity<a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/line-of-credit/\"> Line of Credit,</a> and Tailored Home Loan.</li>\n<li>Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited is offering Professional Benefits Equity Manager, Equity Manager, Breakfree Equity Manager, ANZ Portfolio Home Loan, and ANZ Portfolio Loan Equity Manager.</li>\n<li>The Suncorp Bank offers two types of equity loans, Asset Line and Money Manager Asset Line</li>\n<li>As for the St. George Bank, it offers Portfolio loan, Standard Variable Rate Loan, Advantage Home Loan with 1-year Discount Variable Rate, and Advantage Home Loan (Portfolio loan).</li>\n<li>Equity Access Loan and Premier Advantage Equity Access Loan are offered by the Westpac Bank</li>\n<li>Commonwealth Bank of Australia is offering a number of home equity loan packages, including MAV package with 1-year Guaranteed Rate, Line of Credit Residential Equity Rate, Standard Variable Rate, MAV Package 12 Month Discounted Variable Rate, MAV Standard Variable Rate, and MAV Package Line of Credit Residential Equity.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Moreover, the interest rate of a home equity loan is much lower compared to an unsecured loan like personal loans or credit cards. It keeps the borrowing cost low. In addition to that, it also gives you a tax benefit. For example, if the fund is being used for substantial improvement, a borrower might be able to deduct some of the interest charges paid. However, make sure you hire a tax expert to help you claim this deduction.</p>\n<p>It provides a certain level of security to lenders as well. The equity portion of the house can be used as a collateral. But despite having a collateral, borrowers should still be mindful of not lending too much. Compare different packages available in the market to make sure they are in line with your financial goals. Speak to our team of experts at Hunter Galloway today.</p>"

Those who sign up for this loan, get a cheaper rate compared to other loan types. However, it all depends on the lender and what features they include in their loan package.</p>\n<p>As a general rule, you should only pay for services you will get in the package and there are certain basic home loan features that will enable you to pay off your obligations sooner. In some cases, instead of choosing the cheapest option, it&#8217;s better to carry out thorough research and compare features of different packages. This will put you in a better position to choose the right option.</p>\n<h3>Basic Home Loan Features</h3>\n<p>Different lenders offer different features, including waived or reduced loan application fees, lower or no ongoing fees, and low-interest. This, however, comes at the price of flexibility. Often you have to forego certain things to be able to get these features.</p>\n<h3>Who Should Apply for Basic Home Loan?</h3>\n<p>Like any other home loan product, a basic home loan is not the right option for every borrower; it has its pros and cons. It doesn’t offer special interest rate discounts to those who borrow over $1 million. Due to the simple and straightforward nature of this home loan type, consider the following before making a decision whether to go for it or not:</p>\n<p><strong>• Applying for Loan of $250,000 or Lower</strong><br />\nThe basic home loan is perfect for those who apply for a loan of $250,000 or less. With this loan type, you can get a lower interest rate than a standard variable rate.</p>\n<p><strong>• Looking for Low Fee</strong><br />\nIf you do not want to pay an unnecessary fee for the services you don&#8217;t use, you can choose this home loan. As discussed, you can request to waive off or reduce the fee and charges by choosing this loan option. It allows you to pay only for those features that you want or need at a very low cost.</p>\n<p><strong>• You Find it Difficult to Change Banks</strong><br />\nSome people find it hard to switch banks. They are either satisfied with the services offered by their existing bank or too lazy to move to another bank. If you fall into one of these categories, it is better to keep it simple and go for a basic home loan without getting additional features.</p>\n<p><strong>• Looking for Simple Feature</strong><br />\nSome prefer having simple arrangements instead of getting caught up in complex financial dealings. If that&#8217;s you, then this home loan is the right choice, as it offers simple terms without any financial hassle.</p>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3>Lenders Offering Basic Home Loan</h3>\n<p>Fees and interest rates associated with a loan vary from one lender to another. But when it comes to the major banks in Australia, they offer almost the same features. Below are some of the banks that offer a basic home loan product:</p>\n<p>• National Australia Bank offers a ‘Base Variable’ home loan<br />\n• The Australia and New Zealand Banking Group offers ‘Simplicity Plus’<br />\n• Suncorp Australia offers ‘Back to Basic’ home loan<br />\n• St George offers ‘Basic Home Loan’<br />\n• Westpac offers Flexi First Option<br />\n• Commonwealth Bank of Australia is offering a 3-year special rate saver</p>\n<p>There are also a number of other banks that offer the same products with different names. Consult our team at Hunter Galloway before making a final decision.</p>\n<h3>How to Find the Cheapest Loan?</h3>\n<p>It is not always easy to find the cheapest loan that is in line with your financial goals. There are so many lenders in the market, which can make it even more difficult to figure out which one is suitable for you. But that&#8217;s where Hunter Galloway&#8217;s team of experts come in. There are a number of other factors to consider when looking for the right loan product. For example, if you do not need a large loan amount, it can be better to focus on the fees instead of interest rates. Make sure you look for the hidden fees as well, especially around the settlement costs or legal fees. In addition to that, try to find a loan product that does not include redraw fees. A number of lenders often waive the application fee if you are a first-time home buyer too. Therefore, keep these factors in mind whenever looking for a home loan. Speak to our team today about a basic home loan and whether it is right for you.</p>"

Normally, people apply for this loan facility to renovate their house. It works just like a credit card as it enables them to draw small amounts whenever they need it. However, the maximum amount you can withdraw is determined on the basis of equity in your house.</p>\n<p>You do not need a bank account with this loan. It is also called all-in-one home loans or all-in-one account because it allows you to manage your income and expenses directly from the loan account.</p>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3><strong>Benefits</strong></h3>\n<p>It is a great product for those who use their money carefully but also want flexibility. Here is a list of benefits it offers to the borrowers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A person does not have to get approval from a lender to withdraw if he or she stays within a credit limit. In fact, it enables you to withdraw large amounts without exceeding the limit</li>\n<li>The interest rate is much lower compared to what is charged on a credit card</li>\n<li>It allows you to easily access the funds via phone banking, internet banking, chequebooks, ATM, etc.</li>\n<li>It also allows you to consolidate all your loans, including auto loan, personal loan, and any other loan into a home loan</li>\n<li>It reduces the interest expense if you decrease the account balance and direct all the funds into the loan account</li>\n<li>Normally, the repayment is made every month. However, a borrower is not required to make any payment if he or she remains within the defined limit.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It has a specific ‘draw period’ during which a person can make repayments modestly. However, as soon as the period expires, a borrower pays off the loan obligation aggressively. Although it has a certain degree of flexibility to make repayments, you should not go for it if you cannot afford higher interest rates compared to a standard variable rate loan.</p>\n<h3><strong>Risks</strong></h3>\n<p>Despite the freedom that comes with a line of credit, you have to maintain a proper budget to stay within the defined limits. Those who cannot make huge additional repayments in the loan account will struggle financially if they refinance their loan with a line of credit. The reason behind it is the high-interest cost that would exceed the savings made after you combine the accounts.</p>\n<p>Moreover, a line of credit home loan is an interest only product. It does not have defined terms. This makes the borrower decide when to make repayments on the principal amount, which can be a convenient option for some but disastrous for others. Therefore, in doing so, it is very important for you to manage your finances efficiently or else you won’t be able to pay off your debt.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Lenders Offering Line of Credit</strong></h3>\n<p>Given below is a list of some lenders that are offering a line of credit in Australia</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>National Australia Bank</strong> – offers NAB Home Equity Line of Credit</li>\n<li><strong>Australia and New Zealand Banking Group</strong> – is offering various line of credit products to its customers, including Professional Benefits Equity Manager, Breakfree Equity Manager, Equity Manager, ANZ Portfolio Home Loan, and ANZ Portfolio Loan Equity Manager.</li>\n<li><strong>Suncorp Australia</strong> – has two line of credit products, Asset Line and Money Manager Asset Line</li>\n<li><strong> George Bank</strong> – is offering Portfolio Loan Variable Rate and Advantage Home Loan Package</li>\n<li><strong>Westpac</strong> – has two products, Equity Access Loan, and Premier Advantage Equity Access Loan</li>\n<li><strong>Commonwealth Bank of Australia </strong>– offers Line of Credit Residential Equity and MAV Package Line of Credit Residential Equity</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are so many lenders in Australia that offer a line of credit. The fees and interest rates might vary from one lender to another, but almost every financial institution offers the same features like internet banking or ATM access.</p>\n<p>The line of credit is suitable for those people who do not have a fixed income, but they are able to make large repayments. If you can afford high-interest charge and want flexibility, this loan type is right for you.</p>"

If so, you might want to shop around in the specialist lending market.</p>\n<p>Specialist lending is a segment of the mortgage market that is intended for borrowers who generally do not meet the standard criteria that lenders set. A number of reasons might prevent you from being able to meet these criteria &#8212; there is no single reason why you and every other specialist borrower would be in this category.</p>\n<p>At Hunter Galloway, we have identified some of the most common reasons that you might need a specialist lender:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You don’t meet some of the most important mainstream criteria<br />\nThese mainstream criteria include a range of factors, from residency requirements to failing to meet LMI.</li>\n<li>You have an impaired credit history<br />\nAn impaired credit history is a major red flag for nearly all lenders, which means they will consider you risky and probably be hesitant to give you a traditional loan. Your credit history may be impaired if your debt payments have been late or you have had to file for bankruptcy.</li>\n<li>You aren’t able to provide the standard documentation<br />\nSome of the most important documentation will be that related to your employment status. However, if you have been self-employed or given money by your parents, you might have a gap in your income which will make your loan application quite complicated.</li>\n<li>You need a flexible solution<br />\nCertain clients require a flexible solution, e.g. they wish to consolidate multiple loans or they want to cash out part of their loan for the purpose of a business investment. This might be considered risky by a bank, impacting their willingness to give a traditional loan.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Specialist Lenders &#8212; How Different Is Specialist Lending?</h2>\n<p>A specialist lender offers a loan in much the same way as a mainstream lender. However, they tend to require different criteria for the application process. At Hunter Galloway, our experience is that a specialist lender uses a much more personalized approach to determining whether they will give you a loan:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>They do not use credit scoring</li>\n<li>Customized approach to assessing every application</li>\n<li>Evaluating each individual client’s personal circumstances</li>\n<li>More inclusive credit policy</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Specialist Mortgage Lenders</h3>\n<p>A specialist lender is a great alternative option for many clients who are unable to meet some of the more formal criteria given by traditional lenders. At Hunter Galloway, we understand that you might not be interested in specialist lenders, but sometimes this can be your only option. Our general strategy is to shop around for all types of loans, but to focus on the benefits of receiving a loan from a specialist lender, if necessary.</p>\n<p>For more information about specialist lenders and ways that our mortgage brokers at Hunter Galloway can provide all the details you need to get the best possible loan, feel free to contact us.

Is it right for you financially?</strong></h3>\n<p>Firstly, you need to consider whether this decision makes sense for you financially.</p>\n<p>If this is going to be your first investment property, you may not be familiar with the risks and costs of renting out your home. You will be paying two mortgages, and while rent should cover most of the repayments on your investment property, there may be times when you don’t have a tenant or other unexpected costs. Make sure that you have room in your budget to allow for these unexpected costs.</p>\n<p>Beyond that, you will also need to take into account the tax implications of your decision.</p>\n<p>For example, if you have paid off a lot of debt on your original home and are planning to leverage this equity to finance your new residence, you will have an investment property with little to no debt, and a new residence with a large debt.</p>\n<p>This is the opposite of what you want. Interest on investment properties is tax deductible, while interest on your residence is not.</p>\n<p>In cases like this, you are likely better off selling your current property and using the proceeds to make a deposit on your new residence, which means a smaller debt on your non-deductible loan. If you still want to get an investment property, you can use the equity to leverage a loan for a different investment property (which will be 100% tax deductible).</p>\n<p>A simple switch like this could save you thousands of dollars every year.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"wpb_text_column wpb_content_element \">\n<div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n<h3><strong>2. Is it right for you emotionally?</strong></h3>\n<p>You might want to keep your current property as an investment because you are attached to your home and can’t bear the thought of selling it. This is a normal feeling – there are usually a lot of important memories that are linked to our homes.</p>\n<p>But if you really love it, can you bear to see strangers living in your home? What happens if you get bad tenants who trash your home and cause irreparable damage?</p>\n<p>Owning an investment property can be stressful enough without the added worry about someone ruining a house you feel so strongly about. In that case, you might be better off with a clean break  and you should sell your house and look for investment opportunities elsewhere.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"wpb_text_column wpb_content_element \">\n<div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n<h3><strong>3. Is it the best investment you can make?</strong></h3>\n<p>The mindset behind buying property for investment and buying a home are very different. When investing, your decisions should be 100% logical (just like any other investment decision). When buying a home, emotion is almost as important as logic.</p>\n<p>The chances are that you bought your home because it means something to you, not necessarily because it is in a high growth area or in an area with above average demand for rentals. The areas that we choose to live in do not always deliver the greatest returns on investment.</p>\n<p>Before committing to keeping your current home as an investment, do some research to see what kind of properties you could buy for a similar amount of money elsewhere. This will help you make sure that you maximise the returns on your investments.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a alt=\"\" class=\"btn_yellow rc_open on_page\" style=\"margin: 0 auto; margin-top: 20px;\">Get a Free Assessment</a></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><strong>Critical factors for success when renting out your home</strong></h2>\n<p>If you’ve decided to rent your home out, there are several key factors that you will need to optimise to ensure that you get the best return on your investment and don’t end up in an awkward financial situation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3><strong>Positive or negative gearing?</strong></h3>\n<p>The best loan structure for your investment depends on whether you will have positive or negative gearing.  Do you expect your property to earn more income in rent than the cost of repayments, rates and management fees? In that case, it will be positively geared. On the other hand, if you don’t expect to recoup the cost of your repayments and other expenses, your investment will be negatively geared.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>It’s important to think about this, as it will affect the decisions that you make when applying for your loan and setting up your structure.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"wpb_text_column wpb_content_element \">\n<div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n<h3><strong>Structure for success</strong></h3>\n<p>If you bought your residential property with a spouse or partner, you most likely put the loan under both of your names.  This makes sense for a residence for many reasons, including making sure that your share automatically goes to your partner if anything happens to you.</p>\n<p>Investment property is different. In order to minimise your tax burden, it is usually better to have the property under only one of the couple’s names. If your property is positively geared, it’s better that the property is in the name of the lower income earner – that way you are taxed less on the profits. If your property is negatively geared, it makes more sense to have the property in the name of the higher income earner. This will mean that they can make all of the tax claims and get more tax back (as they are likely paying a higher marginal rate).</p>\n<p>If you keep your existing home under the same loan structure as you bought it with, you may lose out on these very useful deductions. The cost of this could be far greater than you think – up to tens of thousands of dollars.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<h3><strong>Depreciation</strong></h3>\n<p>When you have an investment property, you are entitled to claim depreciation on building costs, fixtures, fittings and furniture. If you are switching over from an owner-occupied property to an investment property, you will need a quantity surveyor to estimate the present value of your building, fixtures, fittings and furniture. Once you switch over, you can claim any balance of depreciation costs and gain substantial tax breaks.</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"wpb_text_column wpb_content_element \">\n<div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n<h3><strong>How to get the right loan</strong></h3>\n<p>Many banks and lenders now offer investment property loans. These have different rates, criteria and benefits to residential loans. You can also choose to apply for an interest-only loan which means that you can pay any extra income into your new home, minimising the non-deductible interest you need to pay.</p>\n<p>You should also investigate the possibility of refinancing your existing loan to make sure that you benefit from some of the structuring advantages and other things mentioned above.</p>\n<p>With hundreds of different loans available on the market, it can be extremely challenging to search through all of the different options and find the loan that is best for you. Luckily, you don’t need to do it alone.</p>\n<p>Hunter Galloway has an experienced team of brokers who live and breathe finance.

And then mountains of paperwork to secure a loan and buy the property.</p>\n<p>And the larger your portfolio grows, the more complicated things get.</p>\n<p>Your time is your most precious commodity. You can always make more money, but time is the one resource that is non-renewable. Once you’ve spent it, it’s gone.

Finding the right home to buy is hard enough – and that’s only one of the many steps you need to take before you can move in and start living the Great Australian Dream.</p>\n<p>With so many things to take care of, the process can be stressful and overwhelming at times.</p>\n<p>Luckily, you don’t have to do it alone. Here at Hunter Galloway we’ve helped hundreds of first home buyers take that first step into owning property.

First and foremost, you need to take a hard look at your finances. You should find out the size of loan that you will qualify for and look at what kind of repayments you can afford without overextending yourself.</p>\n<p>It’s also worth taking some time to look at the various grants that are available to you as a first home buyer. For example, the QLD government will give you up to $20,000 if you are buying a new house or apartment.</p>\n<p>The best thing to do before you start really searching for a home is to get pre-approval for a home loan. This means that you know exactly how much you can afford to pay and will help you narrow down your search.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"wpb_text_column wpb_content_element \">\n<div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n<p>Buying the right house takes a lot of consistent hard work and time. If you just go out and buy the first house that you see, chances are that you will get sub-optimal results.</p>\n<p>Before you start looking, you should write down a list of what you’re looking for. What area would you like to live in? How many bedrooms? What other features would you like to have? What are you willing to compromise on, and what is a ‘must-have’?</p>\n<p>Once you’ve got a good idea of what you’re looking form you should get into a routine of searching for homes. For example, you could dedicate time every evening for research, and plan to dive around and do inspections on weekends.</p>\n<p>There are also plenty of resources that you can use to learn more about property purchase. You can research online, read books, or <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/free-assessment/\">get some advice from an experienced professional</a>.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"wpb_text_column wpb_content_element \">\n<div class=\"wpb_wrapper\">\n<p>Buying the right house takes a lot of consistent hard work and time.

The requirements may vary between lenders, however, the below documents are the standard requirements.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Identification (100 points)</li>\n<li>Birth certificate (70 points)</li>\n<li>Passport (70 points)</li>\n<li>Citizenship certificates (70 points)</li>\n<li>Diplomatic documents and official documents issued to refugees (70 points)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Secondary: </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Driver’s licence (40 points)</li>\n<li>State or Territory issued photo ID card (40 points)</li>\n<li>Photo ID issued by tertiary education institute (40 points)</li>\n<li>Photo card issued by banking institution where you have been a customer for at least 12 months (40 points)</li>\n<li>Public service ID card including your photo and signature (40 points)</li>\n<li>License or permit issued by State, Territory or Commonwealth government, such as a boating license (40 points)</li>\n<li>Letter confirming your identity from referee you’ve known for at least 12 months (40 points)</li>\n<li>Mortgage documents (35 points)</li>\n<li>Council rates notice (35 points)</li>\n<li>Credit card statement (25 points)</li>\n<li>Foreign driver’s license (25 points)</li>\n<li>Medicare card (25 points)</li>\n<li>Credit card (must have name and signature) (25 points)</li>\n<li>Utility bill with name and current address (25 points)</li>\n<li>EFTPOS card (must have name and signature) (25 points)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Income:</strong><br />\nIf you’re PAYG you will need to provide payslips from the past three months. Bank statements in some cases also suffice.</p>\n<p>Those who are self-employed will need to apply for a low documentation loan which requires a copy of your most recent assessment from the ATO with individual tax returns from the last financial year along with your Business Activity Statement (BAS).</p>\n<p>Furthermore, if you have multiple forms of income you will need documentation from each one. This includes – rental income, shares, Centrelink income.</p>\n<p><strong>Assets and liabilities </strong><br />\nYour assets and liabilities will be reviewed in order to effectively assess your financial position.</p>\n<p>To separate them, assets are what you own and liabilities are what you owe.</p>\n<p><strong>Miscellaneous documents</strong><br />\nFirst home buyers will be required to complete separate documentation for the grant. Likewise for those applying with a guarantor. Insurance and valuation of the property will also need to be complete and the insurance policy and valuation report will be required.</p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"n2-code\"></div>\n<p></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Our award-winning mortgage brokers<br />\n<strong>will find you the right home loan for your situation</strong></p>\n<p></p>"

style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can choose from fixed or variable rates.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fixed rate loans are for those who are wanting certainty and might be a bit more risk-averse. If you want to remove any volatility from your interest costs, and are comfortable with the current rates you should consider fixed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, if you are comfortable with a little bit of volatility and want to be able to make additional repayments to your loan, a floating or variable rate home loan could be the way.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are building a home you will need to use a variable rate loan.</span></p>\n\n<h4><b>Why do fixed rates have an early repayment cost? </b></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fixed rates home loans are a contract between you, the borrower and your bank.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And while they give you the certainty of repayment for that set period, they also give your bank certainty about the interest repayments they will receive over the fixed rate term. This lets the bank make hedging and funding arrangements to match.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In making these hedging and funding arrangements, the bank will incur interest costs. If you as the borrower repay some, or all of your fixed rate early or want to switch before the end of the fixed term the bank will need to change the funding armaments.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For this reason, the bank will charge you an Early Repayment Cost to recover the banks ‘reasonable estimate’ of the costs in changing the arrangements.</span></p>\n<p><b><a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/fixed-interest-rates/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-10194\" src=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/fixed-interest-rates.jpg\" alt=\"fixed-interest-rates\" width=\"1080\" height=\"675\" /></a> </b></p>\n<h4><b>Case Study: Fixed Rate Break Costs</b></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tom takes out a 2 year fixed rate loan of $500,000 at an interest rate of 7%. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One year later, Tom decides to fully repay the loan, and at that time the interest rates in the market are 5%. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tom will need to pay roughly $9785 ($1957 per $500k early repayment) for breaking the fixed rate.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Read More: <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/fixed-interest-rates/\">Is now a good time to fix rates?</a></strong></p>\n\n<h2><strong><span id=\"Chapter_3_Product_Features\" style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Chapter 3: Product Features</span></strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this section, I’m going to show you some of the features of home loan for doctors. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First I’ll teach you the basic features.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then I’ll show you the quickest (and EASIEST) way to find the right loan features for you.</span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-11002\" src=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/home-loan-doctor.jpg\" alt=\"home loan doctor\" width=\"798\" height=\"532\" /></p>\n\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><b>Features on Mortgages For Doctors</b></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Home Loans for doctors are similar to regular mortgages:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>✅</b> <b>Entities</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Individuals, trusts or companies as the owner.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>✅</b> <b>Loan term</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Up to 30 years for residential properties, or up to 25 years for <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/commercial-property-loan/\">commercial property loans.</a></span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>✅</b> <b>Interest Only Period</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Up to 10 years is acceptable </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>✅</b> <b>Extra repayments</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Available on variable facilities</span></li>\n<li><b>✅</b> <b>Offset accounts</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Available with some lenders allowing multiple offset accounts</span></li>\n<li><b>✅</b> <b>100% LVR</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Available with some lenders on single properties </span></li>\n<li><b>☑️ Redraw</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Sometimes available, depends on the lender</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>☑️ Cash Out:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Available, depends on the purpose</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>☑️ Capitalised Interest:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Available, depends on the purpose</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>☑️ Internet Banking:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Available. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Different lenders have different target markets, so their product features will ultimately depend on this. </span></p>\n\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>As a Doctor can I get an interest only no LMI home loan? 🤔</strong></span></h3>\n<p>The answer is YES, you can.</p>\n<p>However, there are certain things you have to consider before getting an interest only <u><a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/home-loans-for-doctors/\">doctor home loan</a></u>. Let’s start by knowing what interest-only loans are and how they work.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8756\" src=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/interest-only-doctor-home-loan.png\" alt=\"interest only doctor home loan\" width=\"1080\" height=\"675\" /></p>\n<h4> </h4>\n<h4><strong>Interest Only Home Loans</strong></h4>\n<p>Interest only home loan is a type of loan that allows the borrower to only make interest payments for the first few years without any increase in the principal amount. However, once the interest-only term period is over, they are required to make both principal and interest repayments.</p>\n<p>Regulatory authorities in the industry have imposed stringent policies, encouraging banks to slow down on the interest-only home loans. But you can still qualify for it, depending on the following factors:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>✅ Purpose of a loan</strong></li>\n<li><strong>✅ How much is the loan amount as a percentage of the property value, and</strong></li>\n<li><strong>✅ The lender you go for.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Interest only home loans are normally beneficial for real estate investors who want to improve their cash flow and are looking for a buffer period during which they can invest money in building a house or for other purposes.</p>\n\n<h4><strong>How Interest Only Loans Works?</strong></h4>\n<p>When you apply for this loan type, lenders do not take into account the interest-only term period while calculating your borrowing power. For example, if your loan term is 20 years, with 3 years of interest only period, the borrowing power will be assessed on a 17-year loan term.</p>\n<p>Since the interest only repayments are small, most banks do not allow fortnightly or weekly payments. Instead, you are required to make monthly interest repayments. Although, you do get immediate cost savings with an interest only home loan in terms of paying small repayment amounts, yet, after 5 or 6 years, you will still owe the same principal amount as you did in the beginning compared to a standard loan.</p>\n<p>So, if you are a medical professional who is looking for an interest only <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/home-loans-for-doctors/\"><u>doctor home loan</u></a>, do consider these factors before signing up for it.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_8410\" style=\"width: 652px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-8410\" class=\"size-full wp-image-8410\" src=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/home-loans-interest-only.png\" alt=\"home loans interest only\" width=\"642\" height=\"582\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-8410\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Interest only home loans do not reduce the principal or balance during the interest-only period.</em></p></div>\n\n<h4><strong>No LMI and Interest Only Doctor Home Loan</strong></h4>\n<p>However, if you are intending to buy an interest only <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/home-loans-for-doctors/\"><u>doctor home loan</u></a> for investment purpose and also get LMI waiver, you can save a lot of money to be invested elsewhere. It will give you a huge cash flow for planned investments in the future. In addition to that, your status of being a medical professional also plays a vital role in getting you a lot of other perks.</p>\n<p>It is important to know that naturopaths, medical research scientists, and psychologists are not included in the list of medical professionals for that matter.</p>\n<p>Apart from an interest only <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/home-loans-for-doctors/\"><u>doctor home loan</u></a>, you can also choose to go for no LMI loan with discounted interest rates.

interest rates?</strong></span></h3>\n<p>Doctors are low-risk borrowers with great incomes, therefore, they receive great discounts and rates. They are favoured due to their low default rate in comparison to any other profession. Due to this, they receive a number of benefits.</p>\n\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Are  Dentists or Doctors eligible for home loans with no LMI?</strong></span></h3>\n<p>Picture this. You&#8217;re a self-employed dentist running your own clinic for the past five years. You&#8217;re income is sitting at around $120,000 per annum with savings sitting in your bank at $200,000. You&#8217;re ready to buy and are considering a 2 bedroom home for around $670,000. What are your options and will you have to pay LMI? Will you be eligible for waived LMI?</p>\n<table style=\"height: 110px;\" width=\"674\">\n<colgroup>\n<col />\n<col />\n<col />\n<col /></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"\"><b>Income</b></td>\n<td class=\"\">\n<div><b>Deposit (%)</b></div>\n</td>\n<td class=\"\">\n<div><b>Deposit ($)</b></div>\n</td>\n<td class=\"\">\n<div><b>Property</b></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"\">\n<div>$120,000</div>\n</td>\n<td class=\"\">27%</td>\n<td class=\"\">$200,000</td>\n<td class=\"\">\n<div>$670,000</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Yes, self-employed Dentists and Doctors are eligible for home loans with no LMI!</strong></span></h3>\n<p>Yes you are! Self-employed dentists are eligible for <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/avoid-lenders-mortgage-insurance/\">home loans without LMI</a> and your tax returns will be evidence to prove this. However, if this isn&#8217;t a possible document then invoices can be used as evidence of income. Lenders are looking at your ability to repay the loan and it certainly isn&#8217;t the first time a self-employed professional has asked for a loan.</p>\n<p>However, due to this, they can sometimes be looked at with an air of caution by lenders, as the income level is not stable and there&#8217;s a higher chance of default. A way to get around this is to show regular and stable income for an extended period. Anything from 2 years + will cover this.</p>\n<p>In order to receive benefits that dentists recieve such as waived Lenders Mortgage Insurance (LMI) or interest rate discounts, you need to be a member of the <a href=\"https://www.ada.org.au/\">Australian Dental Association</a> (ADA) or the <a href=\"https://www.adc.org.au/\">Australian Dental Council (ADC).</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/free-assessment/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8404\" src=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/information-session.png\" alt=\"information-session\" width=\"278\" height=\"48\" /></a></p>\n\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Some weeks I do extra contract work outside of this, how is this income looked at?</strong></span></h3>\n<p>Extra income earned outside of your dental job may be considered when <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/pre-approval/\">calculating your borrowing power.</a></p>\n<p>When it comes to determining income for self-employed professionals, lenders will often consider these factors:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>✅ Income made over the past two years</li>\n<li>✅ Previous tax returns</li>\n<li>✅ The lowest income figures for the previous two years</li>\n<li>✅ Then rental payments and depreciation as shown on your tax return are subject to the lender</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Really what it comes down to is proving to a lender that you have a stable income, but also showing that there is a growth in your income. If your income has decreased over this period, that adds doubt to the process too. In that situation, additional supporting documents will be required such as financial statements.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/free-assessment/\">Speak to our team at Hunter Galloway</a> today for details about your personal situation.</p>\n\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Can I get an interest-only doctor loan with no LMI?</strong></span></h3>\n<p>When it comes to providing a home loan to doctors, you can get a loan of up to 100 percent of the property price and avoid paying the cost of the lender’s mortgage insurance (LMI). Not only that, they can also get significant discounts on interest rates. The reason behind it is simple, they are high-income earners and usually take out loans for investment purposes.</p>\n<p>And to answer your question as to whether you can get an interest only doctor home loan with no LMI?</p>\n<p><strong>The answer is YES, you can. ✅</strong></p>\n<p>However, there are certain things you have to consider before getting an interest only doctor home loan&#8230;.</p>\n\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Can you get No LMI with an Interest Only Investment loan?</strong></span></h3>\n<p>Being able to get no LMI, and interest only Doctor Home Loan comes down to the purpose of the loan.</p>\n<p>If you are intending to get an interest only doctor home loan for <strong>investment purposes ✅</strong> and also get LMI waiver this is completely fine. You will save a lot of money on LMI, and it will give you a huge cash flow benefits for future investments.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, if you are buying a <strong>property to live in (also known as an owner occupied home)</strong> the banks do not like giving Interest Only Doctor Home Loans unless there is a reason, like if you were planning on turning the property into an investment within a few months of moving in.</p>\n<p>There are lots of options for Doctors and medical professionals when it comes to getting a home loan, and at Hunter Galloway we can help so <a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/free-assessment/\">talk to our team and see how we can help.</a></p>\n\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Do Nurses qualify for home loans for Doctors?</strong></span></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.huntergalloway.com.au/home-loans-for-nurses/\">Nurses</a> qualify for a different type of home loan deal, yet not quite as discounted as doctors as they don’t fall into the category of low-risk employees due to lower income.

All of this was provided by the team. Both Nathan and Josh worked tirelessly to get the result and outcome that I needed. They are incredibly personable, professional and a joy to work with.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Thank you so much to Nathan, Josh, Jared and the team for everything that they did for us in the process of buying our first house. They truly made it a seamless process. The team were always so on top of everything and kept us in the loop every step of the way. We will recommend Hunter Galloway to everyone we know! Thanks again boys!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I would recommend Nathan team to everyone. They are very professional and efficient. I previously had unpleasant experience when dealt with bank directly. Lucky, found Nathan, Josh and Jared just on time. Through them, bank even offered the loan more than I need. I could not settle this investment without Nathan&#8217;s help!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>These gentlemen came recommended and I was genuinely impressed; the personalized service and very rapid reply to queries and constant updates was impressive as well as the ease with which they performed all the necessary work. They are very thorough and whilst collating paperwork is never much fun, they make it easy and explain why having all in place first is the best method. Very impressed!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>We had a really great experience with Nathan from Hunter Galloway. Would definitely recommend him to anyone who is looking for a finance broker. He certainly knows his stuff, and his constant communication during the loan approval process was incredible.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>After being stuffed around for over two weeks by another broker &#8211; got in touch with Nathan and had a first-home loan approval within 48 hours of speaking with him. First-class customer service and demonstrated wealth of experience. Can&#8217;t recommend Hunter Galloway enough.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" alt=\"\" class=\"btn_yellow rc_open on_page\" style=\"margin: 0 auto;margin-top:20px;\">Get a Free Assessment</a></p>\n<p></p>"

At Hunter Galloway, we can help you maximize your borrowing power and make sure that you attain your investment goals as fast as possible.</p>\n<p>To begin with, it is important to keep in mind that the terms of approval for investment loans is relatively complicated compared to other loans. This is the case because investment loans are considered higher risk, relative to regular home loans. As a result, you need to be in a pretty strong financial position in order to qualify. At Hunter Galloway, we have summarized some of the main criteria for being able to qualify for an investment loan:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You should be able to prove that you have between 5 and 10% in savings</li>\n<li>Your credit score should be above average</li>\n<li>You should be able to prove that you have been employed in a stable job for a period of time</li>\n<li>If you decide to borrow more than 90%, you should have equity in other properties</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Although these are general guidelines of what to expect, if you want to know what is required of you personally, it’s best to contact one of our brokers at Hunter Galloway for more information.</p>\n<h2>Investment Loan Borrowing Capacity</h2>\n<p>Are you looking for ways to increase your borrowing power? There are certain things you might be able to do to ensure that you can borrow more as part of your investment and equity loan. Take a look:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reducing the limits on your credit card(s)</li>\n<li>Applying for the loan with your partner/spouse so that both of your incomes can be considered</li>\n<li>Targeting lenders that have favorable criteria for clients applying for investor loans</li>\n<li>Fixing your interest rate for a period of time (three to five years)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Banks differ in the terms that they use to evaluate investment loan applications. Depending on the criteria required, your situation may differ, leading your borrowing capacity to increase or decrease. If you are interested in finding out a way to increase your borrowing capacity relative to your situation, feel free to contact Hunter Galloway for advice.</p>\n<h3>Bank Requirements For Investment Property Loans</h3>\n<p>Do banks have requirements regarding the type of property that I am investing in?</p>\n<p>Yes, some banks do. However, these criteria also depend on the bank. Generally speaking, we believe these are some points to go by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The property must be greater than 50 m2 in living area</li>\n<li>It must be in a high demand area, i.e. a town that has more than 10,000 people</li>\n<li>It must be in a good condition</li>\n<li>The property type must be a standard house, apartment unit or land and construction</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Overall, while this entire process may seem complicated, the investment loan is an excellent option for individuals who are interested in making a particular investment. However, you should keep in mind that borrowing 95% for an investment property is mostly considered suitable for high earning individuals who are in a very strong financial position. In addition, it is important to have substantial knowledge about property investment and experience building a property investment portfolio.</p>\n<p>Take a look at some of the advantages of investing in property:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Secure investment<br />\nProperty investors are known for experiencing fixed returns on their investments, generally with very little risk involved.</li>\n<li>Tax reductions<br />\nSpending money on this property (e.g. through rates, insurance or maintenance) may be subject to tax deductions.</li>\n<li>Constant returns<br />\nBy renting out your property, you will have constant returns in the form of rent. This will effectively mean that the property will ‘pay itself off.’</li>\n<li>Asset base<br />\nHaving an asset base is excellent because it acts as a guarantee for when you are looking to apply for additional finance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Investment property loans can be complicated, but if you know the ins and outs of the process, you can get a lot out of them.

It’s not just numbers on a screen. Reliability and predictability in terms of long-term capital growth and rental return are some of the reasons why property is favoured.<br />\nFor those within a high tax bracket, leveraging the benefits of negative gearing is also a favourable part of investing.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s the difference between an investment loan and an ordinary home loan?</strong><br />\nThe fundamentals of an ordinary loan and an investment loan are more or less the same. However, an investment loan has a slightly higher rate than the normal loan and that’s more or less the only difference. You are offered the same options and features between the two, which means that they cross over well.</p>\n<p><strong>How much deposit do I need for an investment loan? </strong><br />\nIt depends on the situation and whether you’ve got equity which we can leverage. Cash requirement is about a 10% deposit plus stamp duty. If you’ve owned an investment property before &#8211; you might not need a deposit because we can use your equity, however, this is a case by case basis so speak to the team at Hunter Galloway.</p>\n<p><strong>Why should I choose Hunter Galloway for investment loans?</strong><br />\nHunter Galloway specialise in assisting investors. Having worked with many investors, we are able to cross pollinate best practices of investors and share that with our customers to ensure they get the best set up and maximise tax deductibility.
